Deviations in residential real estate intrinsic values occur due to a multiplicity of attributes and explanatory factors requiring consideration. We conduct a panel study using a Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based framework that utilizes the skills and knowledge of a panel of residential real estate professionals (i.e. appraisers and realtors). We demonstrate how cognitive mapping and the Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH) may assist in estimating appropriate offer/sale prices and strengthening current valuation approaches such as using comparables and/or hedonic modeling. The managerial implications of our MCDA-based framework and some avenues for future research are also presented.},

Selection of wastewater reuse application for different uses is a multidimensional process which involves multiple criteria and multiple stakeholders. Multi-Criteria Decision-making (MCDM) approach is often used to solve various decision-making problems. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method has been widely used to solve MCDM problems. In this study, a MCDM model based on AHP has been implemented in order to find the best alternative for using wastewater in Iran as a case study. For this purpose, a hierarchy structure with different levels (four criteria, sixteen sub-criteria, and five alternatives) is applied, and after performing the model and sensitivity analysis, the results are presented. Results show that groundwater recharge is the best alternative for wastewater reuse, followed by environmental use. The applied method is an effective approach and could help decision-makers through giving solutions to manage water resources.},

   abstract = {Objective: A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model was used to evaluate the benefits and risks of traditional Chinese medicine preparations of sinomenine alone or in combination with conventional drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to provide a basis for the rational clinical application of sinomenine. Methods: A study search was performed using six major databases, and Review Manager 5.3 was used for data analysis. Then, an MCDA model evaluation system was established for the treatment of RA with sinomenine preparations, and the benefit values, risk values, and total benefit-risk values of sinomenine preparations alone or in combination with conventional drugs were calculated using Hiview 3.2 software. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations were performed using Crystal Ball embedded in Excel software to calculate the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and the probability of the differences between the 2 drug regimens was determined to optimize the evaluation results. Results: Forty-four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Quantitative assessment of the MCDA model showed that the sinomenine preparation alone offered less benefits than when combined with conventional drugs with a benefit difference of 20 (95% CI 3.06, 35.71). However, the risk of the combination was significantly lower with a risk difference of 13(95% CI -10.26, 27.52). The total value of the benefit-risk of sinomenine alone and in combination with conventional drugs was 46 and 53 at 60% and 40% of the benefit-risk ratio of the two dosing regimens, respectively, with a difference of 7 (95% CI -4.26, 22.12). The probability that the comprehensive score of the combined regimen is greater than that of sinomenine alone is 90.1%, and the evaluation was steady. Conclusion: The benefit-risk of the combined application regimen of sinomenine is greater than that of sinomenine alone.},

   abstract = {Background: Despite the proven value of multicriteria decision analysis in the health field, there is a lack of studies focused on prioritising victims in the Emergency Medical Service, EMS. With this, and knowing that the decision maker needs a direction on which choice may be the most appropriate, based on different and often conflicting criteria. The current work developed a new model for prioritizing victims of SAMU/192, based on the multicriteria decision methodology, taking into account the scarcity of resources. Methods: An expert panel and a discussion group were formed, which defined the limits of the problem, and identified the evaluation criteria for choosing a victim, amongst four alternatives illustrated from hypothetical scenarios of emergency situations—clinical and traumatic diseases of absolute priority. For prioritization, an additive mathematical method was used that aggregates criteria in a flexible and interactive version, FITradeoff. Results: The structuring of the problem led the researchers to identify twenty-five evaluation criteria, amongst which ten were essential to guide decisions. As a result, in the simulation of prioritization of four requesting victims in view of the availability of only one ambulance, the proposed model supported the decision by suggesting the prioritization of one of the victims. Conclusions: This work contributed to the prioritization of victims using multicriteria decision support methodology. Selecting and weighing the criteria in this study indicated that the protocols that guide regulatory physicians do not consider all the criteria for prioritizing victims in an environment of scarcity of resources. Finally, the proposed model can support crucial decision based on a rational and transparent decision-making process that can be applied in other EMS.},

The computational effort depends mainly on the number of model runs, the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, the number of criterion maps, and the model complexity. The current Spatially-Explicit Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis (SEUSA) approach employs a cluster-based parallel and distributed Python-Dask solution for large-scale spatial problems, which validates and quantifies the robustness of spatial model solutions. This paper presents the design of a framework to perform SEUSA as a Service in a cloud-based environment scalable to very large raster datasets and applicable to various domains, such as landscape assessment, site selection, risk assessment, and land-use management. It incorporates an automated Kubernetes service for container virtualization, comprising a set of microservices to perform SEUSA as a Service. Implementing the proposed framework will contribute to a more robust assessment of spatial multi-criteria decision-making applications, facilitating a broader access to SEUSA by the research community and, consequently, leading to higher quality decision analysis.},

We use Iran as a case for the analysis. The framework includes identifying and removing barriers that prevent the use of renewables.

In the analyses, the mutual weight of strategic criteria is employed such as technology, economy, energy vulnerability, security, global effects, and human wellbeing. Using the integrated model, we find that solar energy would be the preferential renewable energy source for Iran.

Another drawback of fossil fuels is several threats like environmental pollution and global warming, which are potential risks for future generations. Given that the transportation sector makes a huge contribution to carbon emissions, the importance of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which are an eco-friendly form of vehicles is obvious. Because the BEV market has been rapidly expanding recently, it has become a significant issue to assess BEV alternatives comprehensively from the customer's point of view. This assessment can be made by addressing the basic features of each BEV. Further, multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques are efficient instruments for the right BEV purchase decision. In this work, therefore, ten BEVs are chosen as alternatives. These vehicles are then ranked using SECA, MARCOS, MAIRCA, COCOSO, ARAS, and COPRAS multi-criteria techniques on the basis of technical specifications, such as acceleration, price, battery, range, and so on. Afterward, results from various MCDM techniques are aggregated by applying the Borda count and Copeland ranking methodologies. “Price”, “permitted load,” and “energy consumption” are determined as the most three significant factors for BEV selection, respectively, whereas Tesla Model S is highlighted as the best choice. Further, the robustness and reliability of the results are performed by applying a sensitivity analysis. The proposed framework can be utilized as a basis for more detailed purchasing decisions.},

The integration of the Bonferroni functions into the CoCoSo method (CoCoSo'B) enables: (1) flexible decision-making respecting the interaction between decision attributes; (2) the elimination of the influence of extreme/awkward data on the values of the criterion functions, and (3) checking the robustness of the results through a variation of the parameters λ, p, and q. Testing the model on the example of sustainable supplier selection demonstrates the rationality, objectivity, flexibility, and stability of the results of the proposed model.

Therefore, finding the best approaches to achieve companies’ goals is a crucial concern in supply chain management, and the majority of organizations prefer to cooperate with reliable and sustainable companies. In designing a supply chain, the supplier selection problem, order size identification, and order allocation are midterm decisions that are needed to be made separately. To this end, three levels of the supply chain, i.e., suppliers, central warehouses, and wholesalers are considered. In the first level, to address the sustainable supplier selection problem, a novel hybrid approach based on the fuzzy logic is implemented. This approach applies the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) method to ranking criteria and sub-criteria, the fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is applied to identification of the relationships among the main criteria, and the fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to prioritizing the suppliers. After prioritizing the suppliers, the obtained weights are considered as the input of a tri-objective model designed to optimize the proposed supply chain. The objectives are minimization of the total cost of the chain, maximization of the weighted value of products by taking the account of suppliers’ priorities, and maximization of the reliability of the supply chain. Weighted Goal Programming (WGP) method is then used to deal with multi-objectiveness. To assess the applicability of the suggested methodology, a case study of the lamp supply chain was considered and solved using GAMS/CPLEX solver and optimal policies based on suppliers’ sustainability. The reliability of the supply chain was tested, and sensitivity analyses were also performed on the main parameters of the model.},

The advantages of the developed method are: the consideration of an anti-ideal and ideal solution at the very beginning of the formation of an initial matrix, closer determination of utility degree in relation to both solutions, the proposal of a new way to determine utility functions and their aggregation, the possibility to consider a large set of criteria and alternatives while maintaining the stability of the method.

Sustainability in the supplier selection process in the medical industry is a strategically important issue, and poorly implemented in the private medical sector.

The success of an offshore wind energy project depends on the selection of the optimal offshore wind power station (OWPS) location, which is often determined through the use of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). There are, however, a number of shortcomings in the use of MCDM methods for site selection: 1) the incomplete utilization of information and loss of data in the decision-making process; and 2) the interaction issue in the neutrosophic vicinity is neglected. In this study, to address those shortcomings, we propose a new hybrid methodology for the selection of offshore wind power station location combining the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE)-II methods in the neutrosophic environment. First, a comprehensive index system of evaluation criteria is constructed of OWPS site selection. Then, the neutrosophic set is utilized in the specialist committee decision to express incomplete information. Furthermore, by gathering opinions of specialists, we take into consideration the interaction problem. Through the development of the hybrid method, this research presents rigorous methodological support for site selection in order to achieve benefits in coastal management. The proposed methodology for OWPS site selection is validated through the use of a case study from Egypt.},

   abstract = {New energy investment assessment has a significant effect on facilitating the new energy industry’s development. Reasonable evaluation methods can effectively reduce the risk of new energy investment and push forward the sustainable development of new energy resources. However, there are few research results in this area, especially in the complex decision-making environment. Thus, to make up for that, an integrated multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) framework is developed to assess the new energy investment problems. First, considering the complex decision-making environment of new energy investment, hesitant fuzzy dual linguistic term sets (HFDLTSs) are applied to represent the new energy alternative evaluation values. Due to the cloud models can reflect the fuzziness and uncertainties of linguistic information, an algorithm is proposed to realize the quantitative transformation from HFDLTSs to cloud models. Second, in view of the heterogeneity of decision makers (DMs) regarding to different attributes, a cloud model similarity-based method is proposed to derive the weight information of DMs. Then, an integrated TOPSIS–ORESTE method with cloud model is established to rank the new energy investment alternatives. The proposed method could overcome the information loss due to Besson’s ranks. In addition, the global preference score considers the ideal and negative solutions relative to the traditional ORETSE method. Finally, a case study on new energy investment of Shandong province, China is conducted to illustrate the application of the established MAGDM model. The effectiveness and superiority of the introduced method are further demonstrated through the sensitivity analysis of parameters and the comparison with other representative methods.},

Selecting appropriate suppliers considering circular, and sustainability aspects for all industries is of great significance. However, addressing sustainable circular supplier selection (SCSS) problems is a difficult task due to the uncertainty in real-life cases in terms of possible future events and experts&#x2019; judgments. This article aims to address the SCSS problem considering the impacts of possible future events via a multiple-criteria decision-making framework. For this purpose, stratification theory is utilized to develop and practice a novel framework called stratified fuzzy full consistency method to identify the optimal weight coefficients of criteria considering the possible impacts of future events. Later, a novel extension of mixed aggregation by comprehensive normalization technique under fuzzy environment is developed to prioritize suppliers with respect to sustainability and circular economy criteria. To prove the practicability of the developed methodology, outcomes of a real case study related to a textile company in Turkey are presented. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses and a comparative analysis are conducted to illustrate the proposed model&#x0027;s performance under different conditions.

In this field, the literature shows that the combination of green and agile indicators has been ignored by researchers. Hence, this research attempts to study the SSP considering green and agile aspects, simultaneously. To do this, an efficient hybrid fuzzy decision-making approach is developed based on the Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL), Fuzzy Best-Worst Method (FBWM), Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP), and Fuzzy Vlse Kriterijumsk Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (FVIKOR) methods. Then, to show the efficiency and application of the proposed approach, a case study in the medical devices industry is investigated. After determining the main indicators and alternatives, the interrelationships between indicators are identified employing FDEMATEL. Then, the weights of indicators are calculated using integrated FBWM-FANP. Finally, the potential suppliers are ranked applying FVIKOR. Based on the obtained results, price and greenness are the more important aspects and also material costs, environmental performance evaluation, manufacture flexibility, service level, and system reliability are the most important criteria for the green-agile supplier selection problem in the medical devices industry. Since all of the consistency ratios are less than 0.1, the reliability of the results is proved. On the other side, the results of conducting sensitivity analysis show that by changing the defuzzification methods, there is no significant change in the obtained results that demonstrates the validity of the proposed approach.

Similarly, we define the consistency index to optimize the consensus reaching process (CRP). Regarding the evolution of the consensus network, the Louvain algorithm is used to divide the entire group into several subgroups to ensure that each subgroup is independent but has strong cohesion. By constructing the MCCM based on the satisfaction index and the optimized consensus-reaching process, the group opinions in each subgroup are ranked to obtain the final ranking of alternatives. Finally, to verify the validity of CRP and the practical value of the proposed model, we conduct consensus network evolution and decision-making analysis in the case of a negotiation between the government and polluting companies to achieve uniform pollution emissions.

When applying IVIFS to solve real problems such as Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) problem, how to measure the distance between two Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Values (IVIFVs) is an essential problem. In this paper, a novel distance of IVIFS called Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Jenson-Shannon (IVIFJS) divergence is proposed, which can measure the difference or dissimilarity between IVIFSs. First, we propose a new Evaluation Score Function of the IVIFV, the score function considering the weight of membership and non-membership, which is more flexible than other existing score functions of IVIFV. Then, we find that the Evaluation Score Function is enclosed in a fixed interval, denoted as the largest possible range. Additionally, we find that the Evaluation Score Function can be approximately regarded to have Gaussian distribution over its largest range. Based on this, we propose a novel divergence measure operator for IVIFS named Interval-valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Jenson-Shannon (IVIFJS) divergence by extending from discrete Jenson-Shannon (JS) divergence. Some useful mathematical properties of JS divergence, including boundness, symmetric and triangular inequality, are maintained in the proposed IVIFJS divergence. Next, we design a novel MADM method based on the proposed divergence operator. Further, some numerical examples are evaluated to illustrate the applicability and plausibility of the proposed method by comparing with other existing MADM methods. Then, the robustness and stability of the proposed MADM method are verified through sensitivity analysis on numerical examples.

In this paper, we propose a novel entropy measure of PFS by taking into account both Pythagorean fuzziness entropy in terms of the membership and non-membership degrees, and Pythagorean hesitation entropy in terms of hesitation degree. To be specific, we firstly propose a new cross-entropy measure of PFS to assess the difference of uncertainty between PFSs. By measuring the cross-entropy with the crisp set, we then propose a new entropy measure of PFS, which mathematically proves the satisfaction requirements of the axioms defined for the entropy of PFS. Based on that, we propose weighted cross-entropy and entropy measures which can be used for different applications. Furthermore, we illustrate the superiority of the proposed entropy measures of PFS by the comparisons with existing entropy measures of PFS. In addition, we propose an entropy-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, which intends to minimize the total uncertainty amount of decision matrix to make the deciding result more convincing. As a result, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of the proposed weighted entropy measure in the MCDM method, and a company investment case study is attached to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MCDM method.

Moreover, on the basis of the constructed index system of GLCP evaluation, the presented FFIWAD-TOPSIS method is applied to assess the development status GLCP of five major ports in China. The case analysis shows that Guangzhou Port behaves the best comprehensive performance among the five cities, while Shenzhen Port is the worst.

Thus the multi-criteria analysis showed that the Hydro Power Station is determined to be the most renewable energy supply system in Turkey. Additionally, the Geothermal Power Station, Regulator and Wind Power Station are determined to be the second, third and fourth, respectively.

The proper logistics village selection is a crucial, complicated, and time-consuming process for decision-makers who have to make the right and optimal decision on this issue. Decision-makers need a methodological frame with a practical algorithm that can be implemented quickly to solve these decision-making problems. Within this scope, the current paper aims to present an evaluation tool, which provides more reasonable and reliable results for decision-makers to solve the logistics village selection problem that is very complicated and has uncertain conditions based on fuzzy approaches. In this study, we propose the Improved Fuzzy Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (IMF SWARA), a modified and extended version of the traditional fuzzy Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (F-SWARA) to identify the criteria weights. Also, we suggest applying the fuzzy Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison (F-MABAC) technique to determine the preference ratings of the alternatives. This combination has many valuable contributions. For example, it proposes to use a more reliable and consistent evaluation scale based on fuzzy sets. Hence, decision-makers can perform more reliable and reasonable pairwise comparisons by considering this evaluation scale. Besides, it presents a multi-attribute evaluation system based on the identified criteria weights. From this perspective, the proposed model is implemented to evaluate eight different logistics village alternatives with respect to nine selection criteria. According to the analysis results, while A8 is the most appropriate option, C1 Gross National Product (GNP) is the most significant criterion. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness and validation of the proposed model, and the results of the analysis approve the validity and applicability of the proposed model. As a result, the suggested integrated MCDM framework can be applied as a valuable and practical decision-making tool to develop new strategies and improve the logistics operations by decision-makers.},

Some studies have more specifically investigated the role of sustainable low-carbon suppliers in the maritime sector. In general, sustainability is recognized as a vital philosophy for many industrial sectors since it enhances environmental protection and raises people's and organizations' awareness about social obligations. Therefore, choosing low-carbon suppliers based on the sustainability perspective is important for firms and organizations in order to effectively promote sustainable supplier chain management (SSCM). The present study develops a new fuzzy decision-making approach to rank and evaluate low-carbon, sustainable suppliers (LCSS) through the integration of the Combinative Distance-Based Assessment (CODAS) framework and intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), which results in a new approach called intuitionistic fuzzy CODAS (IF-CODAS). The paper is aimed at making a decision on the IFSs context by considering the decision makers' hesitancy based on both Hamming and Euclidean distances in accordance with the anti-ideal point. To evaluate the weights of the criteria, a new discrimination measure is developed. To show the practicality of the proposed approach, a case study for the assessment of low carbon sustainable suppliers is presented. To validate the developed approach, comparative research and sensitivity analysis were conducted in this study. The evaluation results showed that the fourth low-carbon sustainable supplier with a maximum assessment score degree (0.4747) using the proposed method was found the best option for selecting LCSS based on the sustainability perspective.

Design/methodology/approach In this paper, a two-phase decision-making approach within a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework has been proposed to help select optimal locations among various alternate locations. Both quantitative and qualitative information is collected and processed based on fuzzy set theory and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. Then the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method is incorporated in the framework to assess the overall feasibility of all alternates. Findings A real case of a mobility giant in China is applied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Sensitivity analysis also proves the robustness of the framework. Originality/value This two-phase MCDM framework allows the mobility industry call center location to be selected considering economic, human resource and sustainability elements comprehensively. The framework proposed in this paper might be applicable to other companies in the mobility industry when deciding optimal locations of call centers.},

The F.S.M. typically has to consider multiple factors involving multiple stakeholders and, hence, can be handled by applying an appropriate Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making (M.C.G.D.M.) approach. To address this issue, we develop an M.C.G.D.M. framework to tackle the F.S.M. problem. To handle inherent uncertainty in business decisions as reflected by linguistic reasoning, we embark on constructing a Linguistic Pythagorean Fuzzy (L.P.F.) M.C.G.D.M. framework that is capable of tackling both uncertain decision information and linguistic variables. The proposed approach extends the combinative distance-based assessment (C.O.D.A.S.) method into the L.P.F. environment, and processes decision input expressed as Pythagorean fuzzy sets (P.F.S.) and pure linguistic variables (rather than converting linguistic information into fuzzy numbers). The developed L.P.F.-C.O.D.A.S. technique aggregates the L.P.F. information and is applied to the F.S.M. problem with uncertain linguistic information. A comparative analysis is carried out to compare the results obtained from the proposed L.P.F.-C.O.D.A.S. approach with those from other extensions of C.O.D.A.S. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to check the impact of changes in a distance threshold parameter on the ranking results.},

   abstract = {Selecting a sustainable municipal solid waste management (MSWM) scenario can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and deal with the energy crisis, effectively. However, traditional decision approaches only rank alternative scenarios but fail to manage them. Implementing effective management for alternative MSWM scenarios can save decision costs and improve efficiency. Thus, this paper aims to construct a novel multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) methodology to manage and rank sustainable scenarios. To evaluate sustainable MSWM scenarios, a comprehensive evaluation index system is constructed from five dimensions including economy, environment, society, technology, and energy. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is employed to articulate evaluation information. Given the importance of experts and the incomplete criteria weight information, an inclusion measure-based approach is proposed to obtain expert weights, and the grey relational analysis linear programming model with incomplete criteria weight information is constructed to determine criteria weights. An inclusion measure-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic multigranulation three-way decisions over two universes approach is developed to manage and rank alternative MSWM scenarios. The feasibility of the proposed methodology is illustrated by a numerical case. Triple sensitivity analysis is performed from the perspectives of decision-makers’ risk appetite, expert weight fluctuations, and criteria weight fluctuations. A comparative analysis is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology. This study provides a novel insight to solve MSWM scenario selection and can extensively be applied to handle other MCGDM problems.},

Hence, the desire to curb undue water consumption through the identification of the main factors affecting consumer behavior has become very important in managing drinking water supplies. Modifying the consumption pattern means institutionalizing of a sustainable culture in water consumption among consumers and the identification of the main criteria affecting their behavior. In 2018, a survey was applied to examine the role of mass media advertising in modifying the water consumption pattern in Iran. An integration of fuzzy AHP and fuzzy VIKOR was proposed based on group decision making, and fuzzy trapezoidal sets used to model linguistic variables and to deal with uncertainty in opinions. We devised and conducted a questionnaire with 24 main criteria and 8 sub-criteria to measure the impact of advertising on water consumption. The case study population in this study included all urban households over 15 cities of Iran. A total of 5630 questionnaires were distributed among the various populations with cluster method. Then, by analyzing the results, advertisements using animation had the highest impact on consumer behavior, among the available alternatives, and could play a significant role in modifying the water consumption pattern. Additionally, a fuzzy evaluation technique is performed to validate the result of the applied method. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to validate the stability of the final ranking. Finally, the prioritization results of the types of advertising by the proposed method were compared with the results of the fuzzy AHP method.},

Therefore, this study presents a methodology for ranking phase change materials based on the AHP–TOPSIS and Fuzzy AHP–Modified Fuzzy TOPSIS methods combined with building energy simulations. Thermophysical (thermal conductivity, latent heat of fusion, phase change temperature, specific heat, density, cycling stability, supercooling), economic (initial cost), chemical (toxicity, flammability, corrosiveness), and environmental (recyclability, embodied energy) criteria were considered. The application of the methodology was demonstrated for eight cities of the tropical savanna climate zone.

One of many types of approaches for AM process selection is based on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). Most of the MCDM based approaches have an advantage in taking into account the relative importance of performance parameter types and a few of them also consider the interrelationships of performance parameter types. Each of these approaches can work well in its specific context. They are however not entirely satisfactory, as they do not have the capabilities to reduce the influence of the deviation of performance parameter values on the decision-making result and to capture the risk attitudes of users in their decision-making models. In this paper, an MCDM approach based on fuzzy Archimedean weighted power Bonferroni aggregation operators with such capabilities is proposed for AM process selection. A fuzzy Archimedean weighted power Bonferroni mean operator and a fuzzy Archimedean weighted power geometric Bonferroni mean operator are firstly constructed. Based on these operators, an MCDM approach for selection of AM processes are then developed. After that, four practical examples are adopted to illustrate the developed approach and a set of sensitivity analysis experiments on the basis of these examples are carried out. Finally, qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the approach and the existing MCDM based approaches are reported to demonstrate its feasibility, effectiveness, and advantages.},

The main objective of this combination is to improve the outcomes provided by these methods through increasing the differentiation between the alternatives in fuzzy TOPSIS and decreasing the incomparability between the alternatives in fuzzy ELECTRE. In addition, to more precisely compute the criteria weights, the correlation coefficient and standard deviation integrated model (CCSD) are used. This research has been inspired from a real case study in lithium extraction processes. Due to the quite limited mineral resources of lithium and the global efforts to replace a clean and recyclable energy instead of fossil fuels, the challenge for lithium extraction from other resources such as brines and seawater has been increased significantly. The proposed framework helps to select the most suitable process of lithium extraction from brines and seawater based on a complex multi-criteria decision making. In view of the fact that efficiency of the decision-making procedures is significantly depends on the stability of the solution, the sensitivity analysis is performed. The performance and capabilities of the proposed framework are appraised by comparing its results with some existing fuzzy MCDM methods through five lithium extraction processes from brines and seawater, as a case study.

The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) approach has been applied to compute the weight vectors of dimension impacting the (SPIs). The findings depict that technical indicators have significant impact whereas operational indicators have the least impact in the decision-making process of a textile sector.

Further, each of the TTs is assessed based on the technology and its operation, social acceptance, environmental protection, total cost, and health hazards. Finally, the most suitable technology is selected. The process of selecting the most suitable TT can be regarded as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem owing to the involvement of several factors.

   abstract = {Road infrastructure performance is closely associated with passengers and freight transportation systems and socio-economic development. The performance of road infrastructure is commonly measured by sensor-monitored indicators, and the ability of monitored indicators in revealing actual performance is generally determined by decision makers and road users. However, it is usually unreliable to directly apply monitored indicators in road performance evaluation, due to the limited aspects of individual sensor-monitored indicators, and potential biases and uncertainties of human experience. To address the issues, this study proposes a model-driven fuzzy spatial multi-criteria decision making (MFSD) approach to derive a comprehensive and accurate indicator of sustainable road performance. In this study, the MFSD approach is applied in exploring the road network in the Wheatbelt region in Western Australia, Australia. Spatial variables of road properties, traffic vehicles and climate conditions are used as criteria in the decision making. Four sensor monitored indicators are collected for estimating contributions of criteria. Results show that the MFSD-based indicator can more comprehensively and accurately characterize sustainable road infrastructure performance. In the study area, the MFSD-based indicator can improve 30.46% of the correlation with road maintenance cost compared with roughness, which is the optimal sensor monitored indicator. At the local government areas, the MFSD-based indicator can explain 45.8% of practical road maintenance cost. Sensitivity analysis from multiple aspects indicates that MFSD is a reliable and accurate method in decision making. The proposed method and analysis have broad potentials in the network-level sustainable infrastructure management.},

   abstract = {Energy storage technologies (ESTs) enable to cope with intermittency of energy sources by storing excess energy to use when it is needed. Therefore, evaluation of energy storage alternatives (or technologies) is completely critical and can be exactly considered as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. It is clear that we have to evaluate this problem in terms of both qualitative and quantitative criteria. We should also take into account decision makers’ linguistic evaluations and their experiences. At this point, the fuzzy set theory (FST) that is an effective tool to utilize from human judgments and linguistic evaluations in the decision making process can be successfully used. Hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) that enable to have several membership values between 0 and 1 for an element of the set can be used for this aim as an extension of ordinary fuzzy sets. In this paper, an integrated MCDM model consists of Delphi, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and VIsekriterijumska Optimizcija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) methods has been proposed to evaluate EST alternatives for Turkey under hesitant fuzzy environment. For this aim, a hierarchical decision model consisting of four main criteria and nineteen sub-criteria with nine EST alternatives has been constructed. While hesitant fuzzy AHP (HF-AHP) method has been utilized to determine weights of criteria, the alternatives have been ranked by using hesitant fuzzy VIKOR (HF-VIKOR) method. A sensitivity analysis based on change of some parameters has been also performed to analyze the obtained results and to demonstrate sensitiveness of the proposed MCDM model. A comparative analysis has been also realized to confirm the validity of the proposed fuzzy based methodology. For this aim, hesitant fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (HF-TOPSIS) method has been applied as another distance-based methodology. One of the obtained results of this study is that the criteria economic and technical have been determined as the most and the least important main criteria and the weights of them have been achieved as 0.342 and 0.203, respectively. Additionally, the alternative EST named “Compressed Air” has been determined as the most suitable energy storage technology alternative for Turkey.},

To tackle this concern, many researchers have concentrated on preferring desirable energy sources and adopting multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) approaches for only a single type of user (e.g., agricultural, industrial, tourism, or domestic users). However, every energy user plays an important role in shaping energy policy. In fact, for sustainable energy, it is important to include all main energy users at the same time in energy decision-making. The main objective of this work was to propose a fuzzy MCGDM approach to evaluate and prioritize energy sources in Tunisia from various sectors’ point of views. Many criteria are combined, including the following: technical, economic, social, political and environmental. After applying the fuzzy Delphi method, the proposed approach consists of applying a fuzzy TOPSIS method as a multi-criteria approach. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the results of the proposed approach and to study how the optimal solution is affected by the objective function coefficients.},

This study proposes a novel fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making framework for supplier selection, which integrates quality function deployment (QFD) and interval data envelopment analysis (DEA). The proposed methodology allows for considering the relationships among the product features and supplier evaluation criteria (SEs) and the impacts of inner dependence among SEs by constructing a house of quality (HOQ). Considering that the number of supplier evaluation indicators is greater than the number of suppliers in some cases, the curse of dimensionality problem usually exists. To solve this problem, we combine the HOQ, interval DEA models, and forward-stepwise selection approach to screen supplier evaluation indicators and select the best supplier(s). Through the two-stage supplier selection method, we can achieve the double screening of indicators and determine the final supplier(s). Finally, the application of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a numerical example and a sensitivity analysis is also carried out to verify the stability of the proposed methodology. This study focuses on supplier selection based on the combination of fuzzy QFD and interval DEA, and also provide a new two-phase methodology for DEA indicator screening.},

It is a major activity that can assist manufacturers to identify optimal conceptual design before prototyping can commence. This article presents the identification of optimal conceptual design by hybridizing two Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) models which are; Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) and Fuzzy Grey Relational Analysis (F-GRA). The selection of F-AHP and F-GRA is based on the ability of the F-AHP to determine weights of design features and sub-features without prejudice and the ability of the F-GRA to create comparability elements for the design concepts considering their distances from an ideal design. An extensive analysis on the formulation of mathematical model for the two MCDM models is presented which is followed by the application of the hybridized model to the appraisal of conceptual designs of pipe bending machine. The hybridized model provided satisfactory results by its ability to identify one of the designs as an optimal design considering the values obtained from the fuzzified grey relational grades. The performance of the model was validated by a sensitivity analysis using two defuzzification methods and various values of the distinguishing or resolving coefficient. The variation of the resolving coefficient shows that the application of the hybridized model to design concept selection is viable in terms of stability and uniformity over a wide range of resolving coefficient.},

Unfortunately, the traditional intuitionistic fuzzy distance measurement method cannot accurately reflect the dierence between membership and non-membership data, where it is easy to cause information confusion. Therefore, from the intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN), this paper constructs a decision-making model based on intuitionistic fuzzy cross-entropy and a comprehensive grey correlation analysis algorithm. For the MAEDM problems of completely unknown and partially known attribute weights, this method establishes a grey correlation analysis algorithm based on the objective evaluation value and subjective preference value of decision makers (DMs), which makes up for the shortcomings of traditional model information loss and greatly improves the accuracy of MAEDM. Finally, taking the Wenchuan Earthquake on May 12th 2008 as a case study, this paper constructs and solves the ranking problem of shelters. Through the sensitivity comparison analysis, when the grey resolution coecient increases from 0.4 to 1.0, the ranking result of building shelters remains stable.

Firstly, the linguistic spherical fuzzy numbers (Lt-SFNs) is proposed to express the public's language evaluation information. Compared with the linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (LIFNs) and the linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (Lq-ROFNs), Lt-SFNs have a wider information expression range. Then, in order to integrate the language evaluation information, the linguistic spherical fuzzy weighted averaging (Lt-SFSWA) operator is proposed, which can aggregate the group linguistic evaluation information. Further, the MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison) method is extended to the linguistic spherical fuzzy environment and the Lt-SFS-MABAC method is proposed, which can process linguistic evaluation information and select an optimal alternative from a plurality of alternatives. At the same time, the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of Interactive and Multicriteria Decision Making) method is extended to the linguistic spherical fuzzy environment and the Lt-SFS-TODIM method is proposed. Lastly, we conducted sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis of the Lt-SFS-MABAC method, the Lt-SFS-TODIM method and the Lt-SFSWA method.

Over the last decade, sustainability issues have been often considered in combination with resilient indexes leading to the study of sustainable-resilient supplier selection problems (SRSSPs). The current research on sustainable development, particularly concerned with the strong impact that the recent COVID-19 pandemic has had on supply chains, has been paying increasing attention to the resilience concept and its role within SSPs. This study proposes a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method to solve SRSSPs. The fuzzy best-worst method is used first to determine the importance weights of the selection criteria. A combined grey relational analysis and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is used next to evaluate the suppliers in a fuzzy environment. Triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) are used to express the weights of criteria and alternatives to account for the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent to subjective evaluations. However, the proposed method can be easily extended to other fuzzy settings depending on the uncertainty facing managers and decision-makers. A real-life application is presented to demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed model. Sixteen evaluation criteria are identified and classified as economic, environmental, social, or resilient. The results obtained through the case study show that “pollution control,” “environmental management system,” and “risk awareness” are the most influential criteria when studying SRSSPs related to the manufacturing industry. Finally, three different sensitivity analysis methods are applied to validate the robustness of the proposed framework, namely, changing the weights of the criteria, comparing the results with those of other common fuzzy MCDM methods, and changing the components of the principal decision matrix.},

In this regard, the supply chain of healthcare centers should put all of their efforts into avoiding any shortages of masks and shields as these products are considered as primary ways to prevent the spread of the virus. Since, any shortages in these products would lead to irrecoverable and costly consequences in terms of the mortality rate of patients and medical staff. Therefore, healthcare centers should decide on best supplier to supply required products, considering technical, and sustainability measures. Dynamicity and uncertainty of the pandemic are other factors that add up to the complexity of the supplier selection problem. Therefore, this paper develops a novel decision-making approach using Measuring attractiveness through a categorical-based evaluation technique (MACBETH) and a new combinative distance-based assessment method to address the supplier selection problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high uncertainty, vague and incomplete information for decision-making problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, the developed decision-making approach is implemented under fuzzy rough numbers as a superior uncertainty set of the traditional fuzzy set and rough numbers. Extensive sensitivity analysis tests are performed based on parameters of the decision-making approach, impacts of weight coefficients, and consistency of results in comparison to other MCDM methods. A real-life case study is investigated for a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey to show the applicability of the developed approach. Based on the results of MACBETH method, job creation and occupational health and safety systems are two top criteria. Results of the case study for five suppliers indicate that supplier (A1) is the best supplier with a distance score of 3.308.},

Evaluating the suppliers and selecting the best one based on environmental criteria can facilitate us to reach the objective of green supply chain management. As the assessment generally consists of various alternatives over different criteria, green supplier selection is regarded as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. Hesitant fuzzy set, which is an extension of fuzzy set, is an effective tool to handle the vagueness in such a way that hesitant and flawed information by allowing the degree of belongingness for a green supplier selection over the evaluation criteria. In this paper, an integrated method is developed based on Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) approach to solve the multi-criteria decision-making problems with hesitant fuzzy information. This method is based on hesitant fuzzy operators, some improvement in the conventional WASPAS approach and a procedure for calculating the criteria weights. To calculate the criteria and decision expert weights, we propose new information measures for hesitant fuzzy sets and combine entropy and divergence measures for criteria weights, while we use similarity measure for decision expert weights. Since the uncertainty is an inevitable feature of multi-criteria decision-making problems, the developed approach can be a useful tool for uncertain multi-criteria decision-making atmosphere. Next, a green supplier selection problem is taken to show the usefulness of the developed approach in real-life decision-making problems. The results of this study found that the most significant criteria for green supplier selection were management commitment (0.3119), environmental management system (0.2259) and green product (0.2010). Also, we demonstrate a sensitivity analysis over different parameter values and sets of criteria weight to illustrate the stability of the developed method.

The green supplier evaluation and selection is the essential core of the GSCM, which can directly impact the manufacturer's performance. The green supplier selection can be regarded as a multiple criteria group decision making (MCGDM) problem that involves many conflict evaluation criteria, both being of qualitative and quantitative nature. Due to the increasing complexity and uncertainty of social economic environment, some evaluations of criteria are not adequately represented by numerical assessments and type-1 fuzzy sets (T1FSs). In addition, decision makers (DMs) usually do not exhibit complete rationality under many practical decision situations. In this paper, we extend the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision making) technique to solve MCGDM problems within the context of interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) and present its application to green supplier selection problem. First, we introduce a new distance based on the fuzzy logic and α-cuts of the IT2FSs. Then, an extended novel TODIM method based on prospect theory to solve MCGDM problem under IT2FSs environment is developed. Finally, a green supplier selection example is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is carried out with the aid of granular computing and the comparative analysis with TOPSIS technique.},

Furthermore, new separation measures and ranking scores are introduced to distinguish the preference order of SIs.

To date, to overcome one or more of the uncertainty-related issues, an increasing number of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) models based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods have been developed. However, most of the improvements have not cautiously considered the process of assigning importance weights to risk factors and FMEA team members during FMEA. This study aims to enhance the performance of the classic FMEA and to propose an integrated fuzzy MCDM approach for FMEA. First, a fuzzy best-worst method is used to obtain the weights of risk factors. Second, an integrated structure based on fuzzy proximity and fuzzy similarity entropy weights is developed to obtain the weights of FMEA team members with respect to different risk factors. Finally, a fuzzy VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOm-promisno Resenje) approach is employed to obtain the risk priorities of failure modes. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through an illustrative example concerning risk analysis of a grinding wheel system.

In general, inevitable interactions among decision makers (DMs), when a number of DMs share similar knowledge and experiences, can have a significant impact on the management of decision information directly or indirectly related to DMs, and can easily lead to distorted and unconvincing decision outcomes. In order to model the MCGDM problem in which DMs share a similar background, a consolidated MCGDM model in the context of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) is developed. First, we refine the constructive principles for intuitionistic fuzzy entropy (IFE) and use them as a basis to produce a novel IFE measure simultaneously factoring in the intuitionism and fuzziness of IFSs. With the aim of dealing with the impact on the specifications of the weights of DMs and criteria, an integrated method is then proposed based on the novel IFE measure, 2-additive fuzzy measure, and Choquet integral. Due to their capability of modeling effectively the interrelationships among arguments, the weighted intuitionistic fuzzy Bonferroni mean (WIFBM) and the weighted intuitionistic fuzzy geometric Bonferroni mean (WIFGBM) are introduced to fuse the individual evaluation values of alternatives on criteria. In addition, simple additive weighting based on the WIFBM or WIFGBM is applied to rank alternatives and select the best one. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are explored with a case study of an emergency plan decision-making problem accompanied with sensitivity and comparison analysis.},

First, a novel capability-willingness-risk (C-W-R) evaluation indicator system is established, considering supply risk from a multi-proximity perspective which is tightly tied to collaborative innovation performance, only considered from geographical proximity in previous supplier selection research. Then a hybrid fuzzy-symmetrical multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) model is proposed that integrates fuzzy linguistic sets, best–worst method (BWM), prospect theory (PT) and VIKOR. With this approach, a final ranking is obtained for innovative supplier selection by NEV manufacturers in China. Moreover, sensitivity analysis and comparison analysis illustrate the proposed decision framework’s effective-ness and reliability and dig deep into the buyer−supplier collaborative innovation.

   abstract = {Preference aggregation in Group Decision Making (GDM) is a substantial problem that has received a lot of research attention. Decision problems involving fuzzy preference relations constitute an important class within GDM. Legacy approaches dealing with the latter type of problems can be classified into indirect approaches, which involve deriving a group preference matrix as an intermediate step, and direct approaches, which deduce a group preference ranking based on individual preference rankings. Although the work on indirect approaches has been extensive in the literature, there is still a scarcity of research dealing with the direct approaches. In this paper we present a direct approach towards aggregating several fuzzy preference relations on a set of alternatives into a single weighted ranking of the alternatives. By mapping the pairwise preferences into transitions probabilities, we are able to derive a preference ranking from the stationary distribution of a stochastic matrix. Interestingly, the ranking of the alternatives obtained with our method corresponds to the optimizer of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a particular Bradley-Terry-Luce model. Furthermore, we perform a theoretical sensitivity analysis of the proposed method supported by experimental results and illustrate our approach towards GDM with a concrete numerical example. This work opens avenues for solving GDM problems using elements of probability theory, and thus, provides a sound theoretical fundament as well as plausible statistical interpretation for the aggregation of expert opinions in GDM.},

The paper provides a platform to ease decision process through the integration of quality function deployment (QFD) and grey relational analysis (GRA) in demonstrating main supply chain drivers under fuzzy environment. Methodology: The proposed method is important because of several points: First of all, in a supply chain system, evaluation factors are not really independent and must be addressed in relation to the external factors such as customer requirements. Hence, we have applied QFD tool. Second, due to the constant uncertainty in the supply chain environment, fuzziness among the factors has to be considered. So, an interval valued fuzzy model was implemented. Third, to examine the proposed decision system in reality, it was applied in Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) project. Contribution: An integrated version of QFD and GRA is presented. It is assumed that QFD can act to measure optimal solutions based on the distance to ideal solutions. In an interval-valued fuzzy environment the enormous volume of computation by Euclidean distance doesn't allow decision makers to obtain the results easily. This drawback is addressed using gray relational analysis. The gray relational coefficient is integrated to the fuzzy QFD to measure the distance of potential solutions from ideal solutions. This integration facilitates decision making process in further problems once big data are available. Results: To obtain the importance degrees of logistic indicators in the supply chain, expert team considered the environmental, social & cultural, and economic factors as external dimension of the QFD. The other dimension of QFD includes supply chain drivers such as quality, environmental management system, supply chain flexibility, corporate social responsibility, transportation service condition, and financial stability. The decision model is solved and the ranking of indicators is achieved. A sensitivity analysis helps to test and check the performance of the decision model.},

Current conventional sources are not an adequate level in order to meet this energy requirement. Therefore, it is necessary to consider economic and clean alternative energy sources. In this context, renewable energy sources can be contemplated as a solution for this energy problem. On the other hand, selection among energy alternatives is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem and it is necessary to make an assessment in terms of several conflicting criteria. Sometimes, it may not be easy to evaluate these criteria by using crisp numbers and we need to evaluate by using human judgements and linguistic terms that can be used for a more flexible and sensitive evaluation. However, the fuzzy sets enable to cope with vagueness of evaluations in decision making process. In this study, an integrated MCDM model based on the fuzzy sets is proposed for prioritization of renewable energy alternatives in Turkey. The suggested fuzzy MCDM model combines analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets and hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS methods. Since the type-2 fuzzy sets whose membership functions are also fuzzy and hesitant fuzzy sets that enable to handle situations that an element has several membership value are more able to model uncertainties in decision making process, in this paper a MCDM methodology based on these two methods are suggested to evaluate renewable energy alternatives for Turkey. Interval type-2 fuzzy AHP method is applied to determine the weights of decision criteria, and hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS method is applied to prioritize renewable energy alternatives.

Generally, the evaluation process of sustainable recycling partner (SRP) selection is treated as a multi-criteria decision-making problem due to existence of numerous influencing aspects. To tackle the uncertain information during the process of SRP selection, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets have a good choice, which can refer to a broader range of uncertain decision-making information. Thus, this study presents a combined framework with the additive ratio assessment (ARAS) approach, notions of q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) and information measures, and further implements to tackle the multi-criteria SRP selection problem with q-ROFSs setting. In this procedure, the criteria weights are evaluated with the integration of the subjective weights given by decision-experts and the objective weights obtain from the entropy and discrimination measures-based approach. For this, new entropy and discrimination measures are introduced for q-ROFSs and discussed the effectiveness of proposed measures. To elucidate the applicability of the present methodology, a case study related to sustainable recycling partner assessment is presented under q-ROFSs context. Sensitivity analysis is conducted over diverse set of criteria weights to verify the robustness of introduced framework. The results of the sensitivity analysis signify that the recycling partner SRP1 constantly secures the best rank and despites how sub-criteria weights differ. A comparison with extant methods is made to validate of the results of proposed one. The findings of the work verify that the developed framework is more valuable and well consistent with formerly proposed decision-making models.},

   abstract = {The objective of the present paper is to develop a systematic and sustainability-focused evaluation framework to determine the best locations for wind plants in Vietnam. For the decision-making that influences wind plant site selection, while some criteria can be evaluated based on a numerical database, numerous qualitative criteria must be under experts&#x2019; judgments in the form of linguistic terms and can be represented through fuzzy numbers. In this direction, a two-phase framework of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodologies using the merits of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum-Product Assessment (FWASPAS) is proposed for the first time. In the first phase using DEA, the most potential locations regarding their efficiency on various quantitative criteria are selected. These locations are further assessed in the second phase in terms of qualitative criteria viz. technical, economic, environmental, and socio-political factors. For this evaluation, FAHP was used for criteria weighting, and FWASPAS ranks the provinces. A comparison with the existing locations, sensitivity analysis of criteria, and comparative analysis of methods are performed to support the outcomes of the proposed work. The results illustrate that all methods reach common rankings, in which Binh Thuan province got the highest rank. This shows that the applied models are robust in nature. Implementation of the proposed approach can enable governments and stakeholders to save costs and make the most out of resources in the planning phase of wind power plants or any other renewable energy projects.},

Risks and the solutions are identified based on a literature survey and discussion with the expert’s panel. A hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) framework using fuzzy step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and fuzzy complex proportional assessment of alternatives (COPRAS) is applied to analyse the risks and the solutions. Fuzzy SWARA is used to obtain relative weights of each risk and fuzzy COPRAS is used to rank and select the most efficient solution to manage the risks. The proposed framework was numerically applied to a case organisation involved in manufacturing/remanufacturing activities. The results indicate that initiatives from the management and modification in organisation goals is the top-ranked solution that would mitigate the majority of risks. Government, manufacturer and distributor collaboration to develop action plans and setting up international standards are also prominent solutions to overcome the risks. Further, this research performs a sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the proposed fuzzy SWARA-fuzzy COPRAS framework.

In these methods, if decision-makers hesitate among several linguistic terms, hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs), represented by a set of successive linguistic terms instead of single linguistic terms, may be more appropriate to make evaluations. The notion of a fuzzy envelope for the HFLTSs is a beneficial tool that can be directly applied to fuzzy MCDM methods to elicit comparative linguistic expressions (CLEs). The aim of this study is to present a methodology that combines the fuzzy CODAS (COmbinative Distance-based Assessment) method with the fuzzy envelope of HFLTs based on CLEs to solve a personnel selection problem. In order to examine the feasibility of the presented methodology, a case study on blue-collar personnel selection in a manufacturing firm is conducted. A sensitivity analysis is performed to demonstrate the stability and validity of the ranking results. Furthermore, the ranking results of the presented methodology are compared with various fuzzy MCDM methods, including fuzzy EDAS, fuzzy TOPSIS, fuzzy WASPAS, fuzzy ARAS, and fuzzy COPRAS. The results show that the presented methodology is efficient and stable for solving personnel selection problems in a hesitant fuzzy environment.},

Pythagorean fuzzy sets are superior to the other extensions with a more flexible definition of membership function. A novel Pythagorean fuzzy AHP method has been developed for MCDM.

Furthermore, the comparative analysis with other MCDM methods verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveals the selection of weight has an impact on final priority ranking.

According to the service mode of BSS, we can find that the batteries of EVs are the core component and their prices account for approximately half of the total operation expenses of the BSS, which directly affect its operation and benefits. Therefore, this paper proposes a sustainable battery supplier selection framework for BSS based on MCDM (Multi-criteria decision making) technique. Firstly, two new criteria are put forward based on the consideration of different requirements between BSS and new energy vehicle manufacture. Then, the Triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) are utilized to deal with uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making process. Afterwards, under the consideration of the relationship between criteria and logic importance, the Triangular fuzzy entropy weight method is applied to determine the criteria weights. Subsequently, the MULTIMOORA approach under the Triangular fuzzy environment is applied to rank alternatives. Finally, a case in Beijing, China with sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis are executed to prove the feasibility of the proposed approach. This paper provides a critical tool for investors to select the most appropriate battery supplier of BSS.},

   abstract = {The comprehensive evaluation of ammonia production systems is of great significance for improving the sustainability of energy management and food supply. Therefore, an important contribution could be provided by developing a generic decision-making framework for prioritizing multiple ammonia production systems and identifying the best one. In this view, this paper aims to propose an integrated fuzzy MADM (multiattribute decision making) framework combining fuzzy BWM (best-worst method), fuzzy CRITIC (Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation), and fuzzy GRP (gray relational projection) approaches for the sustainability assessment of ammonia production systems under hybrid information. Comparing with the previous MADM-based frameworks for sustainability assessment, this framework adopts the TFN (triangular fuzzy number) to deal with the hybrid information (ie, crisp numbers, interval values, and fuzzy numbers) that arise from real-world decision-making issues. Accordingly, the weights of criteria can be comprehensively determined by integrating the fuzzy BWM and fuzzy CRITIC, which balance experts’ subjective preferences and system's objective properties under uncertainties in the determination of the weights, while the sequence of alternatives can be reliably prioritized by extending the GRP into fuzzy conditions, which escalates the ranking capability under hybrid information via considering the relationships and relative balance among the alternatives’ performances regarding the multicriteria. Seven alternative systems were studied by the proposed framework, indicating that ammonia generated from hydropower-electrolysis and coal gasification would be more preferable than the others, by considering 12 criteria from the concerns of technological, environmental, economic, and social-political. Additionally, sensitivity analysis and result comparison were conducted to verify the rationality and feasibility of the framework. This work makes a methodological contribution to the MADM-based sustainability research and serves as a reference for developing the ammonia economy in the future.},

Therefore, it is necessary to choose the variety that gives the best results. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to apply multi-criteria decision-making of available varieties, which is, in this paper, done on the example of hybrid varieties of rapeseed that were created by selection at the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad. By applying fuzzy logic, a novel integrated Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) model is developed and rapeseed varieties were evaluated. For determining four main and 20 subcriteria, fuzzy PIPRECIA (PIvot Pairwise RElative Criteria Importance Assessment) method has been applied based on fuzzy Bonferroni operator, while for ranking alternatives fuzzy MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison) method has been used. The results obtained using the novel integrated fuzzy MCDM model showed that the variety A2 - Zorica has the best results, followed by A1 - NS Ras, while the worst results were seen by the variety A5 - Zlatna. These results were confirmed using other five fuzzy MCDM methods. Sensitivity analysis-changing criteria weights showed the worst results in the variety A6 - Jovana, which took last place in the application of 18 scenarios.

The epidemic is spreading fast through various means, as the virus is very infectious. Medical science is exploring a vaccine, only symptomatic treatment is possible at the moment. To contain the virus, it is required to categorize the risk factors and rank those in terms of contagion. This study aims to evaluate risk factors involved in the spread of COVID-19 and to rank them. In this work, we applied the methodology namely, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to find out the weights and finally Hesitant Fuzzy Sets (HFS) with Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to identify the major risk factor. The results showed that “long duration of contact with the infected person” the most significant risk factor, followed by “spread through hospitals and clinic” and “verbal spread”. We showed the appliance of the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tools in evaluation of the most significant risk factor. Moreover, we conducted sensitivity analysis.},

The selection of the appropriate tanker vehicles may be a suitable solution to reduce the risks and increase the efficiency and performance of the fuel transportation companies. However, the selection of a suitable road tanker vehicle is not an easy task for decision-makers as there are many conflicting criteria and many decision alternatives. In addition, decision-makers may have to decide with insufficient information since collecting crisp values may not be possible at all times. Hence, many ambiguities affecting the evaluation results exist in an assessment process performed to select the best tanker vehicle option. This paper suggests a novel integrated fuzzy approach to solve these decision-making problems. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the validation of the proposed integrated fuzzy approach and its results was performed by forming 130 scenarios. The results of sensitivity analysis prove that the proposed model can be applied to solve these kinds of decision-making problems.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study identifies the indicators of firms’ innovativeness from the literature. The concept of neutrosophic numbers has been used to assign different importance weights to individual decision makers to account for the differences in their educational backgrounds and practical experience. An intuitionistic fuzzy based TOPSIS procedure is adapted for ranking the candidate firms based on their performance on identified criteria. The implementation of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through an explanatory example. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to judge the robustness of the proposed framework. Findings: The proposed framework provides an efficient and reliable tool to subjectively evaluate and compare the innovativeness of manufacturing firms. The sensitivity analysis shows that the methodology is robust enough to absorb the noise factors/errors/variations, etc. Research limitations/implications: Motivated by this work, future studies can consider developing an integrated innovativeness index for evaluation of innovativeness of manufacturing firms. The concept of interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy and neutrosophic sets can be utilized to reduce the margin of perceptual errors even further. Practical implications: The study will provide the firms with a framework for benchmarking their innovative performance. The firms can analyze their current performance and reconfigure their resources and capabilities suitably to improve their competitive position. Originality/value: This study is one of the few attempts that have been made to articulate a firm level innovativeness assessment tool for manufacturing firms operating in an industry sector.

   abstract = {Supplier selection problem has gained extensive attention in the prior studies. However, research based on Fuzzy Multi-Attribute Decision Making (F-MADM) approach in ranking resilient suppliers in logistic 4.0 is still in its infancy. Traditional MADM approach fails to address the resilient supplier selection problem in logistic 4.0 primarily because of the large amount of data concerning some attributes that are quantitative, yet difficult to process while making decisions. Besides, some qualitative attributes prevalent in logistic 4.0 entail imprecise perceptual or judgmental decision relevant information, and are substantially different than those considered in traditional suppler selection problems. This study develops a Decision Support System (DSS) that will help the decision maker to incorporate and process such imprecise heterogeneous data in a unified framework to rank a set of resilient suppliers in the logistic 4.0 environment. The proposed framework induces a triangular fuzzy number from large-scale temporal data using probability-possibility consistency principle. Large number of non-temporal data presented graphically are computed by extracting granular information that are imprecise in nature. Fuzzy linguistic variables are used to map the qualitative attributes. Finally, fuzzy based TOPSIS method is adopted to generate the ranking score of alternative suppliers. These ranking scores are used as input in a Multi-Choice Goal Programming (MCGP) model to determine optimal order allocation for respective suppliers. Finally, a sensitivity analysis assesses how the Supplier's Cost versus Resilience Index (SCRI) changes when differential priorities are set for respective cost and resilience attributes.},

However a substantial amount of risk is associated with self-driving vehicles which must be considered by decision-makers effectively. Given that automated driving technology and how it will interact with the mobility system are substantially risky, the risks involved in self-driving vehicles need to be addressed appropriately. The identified knowledge gap of the pre-literature review is that an overview of the identification which completely considers all types of risks related to self-driving vehicles does not exist. In response to this knowledge gap, this study aims to prioritize the risks in self-driving vehicles. Risk prioritization is a complicated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem that requires consideration of multiple feasible alternatives and conflicting tangible and intangible criteria. This study addresses the prioritization of risks involved with self-driving vehicles by proposing new hybrid MCDM methods based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) under Pythagorean fuzzy environment. The result of the proposed model is validated by performing sensitivity analysis. The performance of proposed methodology with Pythagorean fuzzy sets is also compared with those with ordinary fuzzy sets and it is revealed that the proposed method produces reliable and informative outcomes better representing the impreciseness of decision making problems. The findings of this study will provide useful insight to the planners and policymakers for decision making in self-driving vehicles.},

Technology selection is a complicated multi-criteria decision-making (MDCM) problem under several criteria and experts’ evaluation, including uncertainty and subjectivity. Spherical fuzzy set is a powerful concept to cope with uncertainty by presenting a wider decision-making area and identifying hesitancy. A fuzzy MDCM approach based on spherical fuzzy AHP is offered in this study to manage the problem of selecting process mining technology under uncertain and ambiguous conditions. Then, one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis is applied to reduce the decision-makers’ subjectivity. This study results in that Price, Process Discovery, Process Analysis&Analytics are the most relevant criteria to decide PM technology. It is interesting that even although Operational Support is one of the less important criteria, it may change the decision on selecting the best PM technology.},

The selection of sustainable LMD mode is an emerging problem for decision-makers in the logistics industry. The key question is how to determine the best LMD mode from a set of alternatives under numerous criteria with ambiguous, vague, and uncertain sustainability-related information. This paper aims to provide an advanced decision-making approach for sustainable LMD. Firstly, 20 sustainable LMD mode evaluation criteria are identified. Secondly, picture fuzzy sets (PFSs) are exploited to help decision-makers to more naturally express their preferences by voting. Thirdly, a hybrid picture fuzzy criteria weighting method based on the Direct rating and R-norm entropy is developed to compute the importance of evaluation criteria. Fourthly, a novel picture fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution method is formulated to rank alternative LMD modes. Fifthly, the presented picture fuzzy approach for sustainable LMD is implemented in the real-life decision-making context. The results show that 'e-cargo bike' is the best alternative in the Pardubice context. The comparative analysis with three state-of-the-art PFS-based MCDM methods approved the high reliability of the provided approach. The sensitivity analyses of the trade-off parameter and balancing factor confirmed the high robustness of the presented approach. The introduced approach can help decision-makers in the logistics industry to elucidate sustainable LMD mode. It can solve not only the highlighted problem but also other MCDM problems under the picture fuzzy environment.},

Due to some challenging problems of fossil fuels, energy production and distribution from alternative sources are getting more attention. This study aimed to reveal the most proper energy systems in Saudi Arabia for investment. Hence, integrated fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process), fuzzy VIKOR (Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje) and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to Idle Solution) methodologies were employed to determine the most eligible energy systems for investment. Eight alternative energy systems were assessed against nine criteria-power generation capacity, efficiency, storability, safety, air pollution, being depletable, net present value, enhanced local economic development, and government support. Data were collected using the Delphi method, a team of three decision-makers (DMs) was established in a heterogeneous manner with the addition of nine domain experts to carry out the analysis. The fuzzy AHP approach was used for clarifying the weight of criteria and fuzzy VIKOR and TOPSIS were utilized for ordering the alternative energy systems according to their investment priority. On the other hand, sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the priority of investment for energy systems and comparison of them using the weight of group utility and fuzzy DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) approaches. The results and findings suggested that solar photovoltaic (PV) is the paramount renewable energy system for investment, according to both fuzzy VIKOR and fuzzy TOPSIS approaches.

In a context where uncertainties are inherent to natural hazards management decision-making process, the challenge is to systematically take uncertainties into account throughout the assessment process in order to avoid biased decisions. This paper attempts to tackle this challenge by suggesting a methodological approach based on the application of fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods. Uncertainties are addressed in two main ways. First, fuzzy AHP is used to estimate the importance of each of the evaluation criteria. Then, fuzzy weighted arithmetic mean method or fuzzy PROMETHEE are used to prioritize the strategies regarding the set of criteria, considering a compensatory or non-compensatory reasoning in order to derive final ranking. This approach is tested in a case study proposing sensitivity analysis in order to study the impact of the compensation phenomenon and the integration of uncertainty in the choice of a sustainable risk management strategy. This hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach provides a structured framework for identifying the most sustainable strategy under uncertainty.},

Technical parameters such as wind resource, logistical concerns such as distance to shore, and ecological considerations such as fisheries all must be evaluated and weighted, in many cases with incomplete or uncertain data. Making such a critical decision with severe potential economic and ecologic consequences requires a strong decision-making approach to ultimately guide the site selection process. This paper proposes a type-2 neutrosophic number (T2NN) fuzzy based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model for offshore wind farm (OWF) site selection. This approach combines the advantages of neutrosophic numbers sets, which can utilize uncertain and incomplete information, with a multi-attributive border approximation area comparison that provides formulation flexibility and easy calculation. Further, this study develops and integrates a techno-economic model for OWFs in the decision-making. A case study is performed to evaluate and rank five proposed OWF sites off the coast of New Jersey. To validate the proposed model, a comparison against three alternative T2NN fuzzy based models is performed. It is demonstrated that the implemented model yields the same ranking order as the alternative approaches.

For instance, the preference of decision makers possibly causes a misleading decision, thus leading to unnecessary waste of resources. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is to apply the integrated multi-criteria decision method using the 'fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory' (fuzzy DEMATEL) method to consider the cause and effect relationship and then using fuzzy analytic network process (fuzzy ANP) to assign the weight of each relevant criteria. The initial results are useful for strategic procurement planning.

They provide designers structure the information rationally and expose it clearly, at the same time allow accurately and orderly identifying all the elements that determine whether a design is the ideal. These methods consider and evaluate all possible alternatives that give solution to the problem. They may have different purposes in each of the stages of selection of alternatives, first can help analyze the problem, task or objective to break it down into a finite number of requirements, and once established the requirements, as aids in estimating for the importance or relative weight of each criterion for each alternative. Against these advantages, they have a major drawback is the subjectivity when assigning weights to each criterion and the evaluation of the different alternatives for the decision maker. In this paper a sensitivity analysis is done that validates the methodology developed in the framework of an investigation that establishes a systematic decision-making by application sequentially various methods of multi-criteria decision so as to reduce to minimise subjectivity associated with any decision process. Sensitivity analysis determines how the selection of alternatives varies when the relative importance of the criteria or project requirements considered in the selection process is changed.},

   abstract = {This study provides a model for result consistency evaluation of multi-criteria decision-making (MDM) methods and selection of the optimal one. The study presents the results of an analysis of the sensitivity of decision-making based on the rank methods: SAW, MOORA, VIKOR, COPRAS, CODAS, TOPSIS, D'IDEAL, MABAC, PROMETHEE-I,II, ORESTE-II with variations in the elements in the decision matrix within a given error (imprecision). It is suggested to use multiple simulation of the elements estimations of the decision matrix within a given error for calculating the ranks of alternatives, which allows obtaining statistical estimates of ranks. Based on the statistics of simulations, decision-making can be carried out not only on the alternatives statistics having rank I but also on the statistics of alternatives having the largest total I and II rank or I, II and III ranks. This is especially true when the difference in rank values is not large and is distributed evenly among the first three ranks. The calculations results for the task of selecting the adequate location of 8 objects by 11 criteria are presented here. The main result shows that the alternatives having I, II and III ranks for some ranking methods are not distinguishable within the selected error value of the elements in the decision matrix. A quantitative analysis can only narrow the number of effective alternatives for a final decision. A statistical analysis makes the number of options estimation possible in which an alternative has a priority. Additional criteria that take into account both aggregate priorities and the availability of possible priorities for other alternatives with small variations in the decision matrix provide additional important information for the decision-maker.},

   abstract = {Purpose: There have been numerous efforts to tackle the problem of accumulated construction and demolition wastes worldwide. In this regard, this study develops a model for identifying the optimum fleet required for waste transportation. The proposed model is validated through a case study from the construction sector in New Cairo, Egypt. Design/methodology/approach: Various fleet combinations are assessed against the time, cost, energy and emissions generated from waste transportation. Genetic algorithm optimization is performed to select the near-optimum solutions. Complex proportional assessment and operational competitiveness rating analysis decision-making techniques are applied to rank Pareto frontier solutions. These rankings are aggregated using an ensemble approach based on the half-quadratic theory. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is implemented to determine the most sensitive attribute. Findings: The results reveal that the optimum fleet required for construction and demolition wastes (CDW) transportation consists of one wheel loader of bucket capacity 2.5 cubic meters and nine trucks of capacity 22 cubic meters. Furthermore, consensus index and trust level of 0.999 are obtained for the final ranking. This indicates that there is a high level of agreement between the rankings. Moreover, the most sensitive criterion (i.e. energy) is identified using a sensitivity analysis. Originality/value: This study proposes an efficient and effective construction and demolition waste transportation strategy that will lead to economic gains and protect the environment. It aims to select the optimum fleet required for waste transportation based on economic, social and environmental aspects. The usefulness of this study is establishing a consensual decision through the aggregation of conflicting decision makers' preferences in waste transportation and management.},

The stages of multicriteria analysis include indicator selection, data characterization, normalization, weighting, and aggregation. However, due to the various framings of sustainability, non-equivalent approaches could be adopted at each stage, introducing methodological uncertainty. Consequently, depending on the methods chosen, divergent and conflicting conclusions or decisions may result. This paper addresses the issue of methodological uncertainties in sustainability evaluation by analyzing how methodological uncertainties arise during multicriteria analysis, then proposing an analytical framework that employs uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to quantify and manage the effects of methodological uncertainties. The consideration of methodological uncertainties in the structure of multicriteria sustainability evaluation shifts the analysis from deterministic to probabilistic, which is advantageous to arrive at robust and homogenized sustainability conclusions or decisions.},

As the main objective of the present research, investment risk factors of renewable energies in these countries are identified and categorized into five groups as economic, technical, environmental, social, and political using TODIM (Portuguese acronym for Interactive Multi-Criteria Decision Making) method. Then, the identified factors are weighted by the fuzzy-analytic network process (F-ANP) and different renewable energy sources are ranked by COPRAS, MABAC, and GRA methods under uncertainty conditions. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of investment decision making was carried out with the emphasis being placed on the tradability aspect of renewable energy projects. The results show that wind energy has a lower investment risk besides the higher economic justification, followed by hydropower.

The value of an object can be defined from its fitness to fulfil specified objectives, its significance to the people who own or use it, its potential to produce revenues, and a host of other criteria depending on its nature. These criteria are often subjective, relying on judgements issued by several experts, stakeholders and decision makers. This is why the MCDM methods need to formalize the problem so as to make it suitable to be treated quantitatively. Moreover, its sensitivity to variable opinions must be studied to check the stability of the result. We propose to leverage sensitivity analysis to identify the lines of intervention that promise to be the most effective to increase the value of the asset. A simulated example illustrates this strategy. This approach promises to be useful when assessing the sustainability of a reuse or redevelopment project in the cases where the final destination of the asset is still under examination.},

It is crucial to specify locations for electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) to meet the charge demand. The question that arises here is how to make a comprehensive evaluation of the alternative EVCS locations regarding sustainability. This study presents a new integrated group multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach for a robust evaluation of alternative EVCS locations. Two different group aggregation techniques (GATs) are applied to obtain the aggregated weights with AHP (analytical hierarchy process): aggregating individual judgments and aggregating individual priorities. For ranking alternative locations, two MCDM methods, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and MOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization on the Basis of Ratio Analysis) were applied for both aggregated weights. Furthermore, we introduce two types of rankings from the sensitivity analysis based on the most selected alternatives for each rank position and the most selected rank position for each alternative. Finally, an integrated ranking is obtained by combining the results of group MCDM methods and sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of GATs and MCDM methods. The proposed methodology is applied to rank the EVCS locations in Bursa, Turkey, with four main criteria and eight sub-criteria. The similarity measure results indicate that the GAT and the MCDM method have an impact on the evaluation scores and the rankings.

   abstract = {When drilling a well, it is important to choose a reasonable mud density to ensure safe operations. This is not a trivial task because a balanced mud-weight has a complex relation to the uncertain formation conditions and properties. This paper presents a method for conducting sensitivity analysis (SA) over the uncertainties involved in the mud-weight window (MWW) assessment, to learn the most important input parameters for the mud density. The uncertainties in the parameters are taken into account using predrill realizations of the formation conditions (vertical stress, minimum horizontal stress, pore pressure, and temperature) and properties (unconfined compressive strength, tensile strength, friction angle, and porosity). The limit pressures of the MWW are computed to avoid shear and tensile failure. The software used to study well stability returns a mud window that could enable underbalanced drilling while still avoiding borehole collapse; this is emphasized by equating the lower stability limit with shear failure and not pore pressure. However, drilling below the pore-pressure limit entails risks with regard to kicks or blowouts. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is used, but other possible shear failure criteria are discussed as well. The output from the SA is used to evaluate how the possibility of gathering more information about the most relevant parameters can improve our knowledge about the appropriate mud density. This is done in the form of value of information (VOI) analysis, coupling the uncertain variables with drilling decisions in a tradeoff between costs and risks. The interest is on deciding what information to acquire when, at a given depth, the drilling operator must decide on whether to keep drilling or set casing. Additional well data are valuable when they can materialize in improved decision making. The case study presented is from an overpressured shale layer in a field in the North Sea. The focus is on the lower allowed well pressure of the mudweight window for a vertical well, exploring the possibility of underbalanced drilling. The SA shows that the most important uncertainties in this case are pore pressure, unconfined compressive strength, and minimum horizontal stress. The most valuable informationgathering strategy is to observe these main three parameters, which is worth USD 386,980 when acquisition costs are subtracted. The VOI analysis further indicates that data about the rock's unconfined compressive strength are the most valuable in this case, and if the decision maker can afford to acquire only one data type, this should be chosen. Although these results are case specific, we believe that a similar workflow could be useful in other drilling situations.},

In the preparation phase, the simulation modeler performs Morris sensitivity analysis to fixate insignificant model inputs and to identify non-linearity and interaction effects. Next, a representation of the global design space is obtained from thousands of simulations using low-discrepancy sequences (LPτ) for sampling. From these simulations, the modeler constructs fast metamodels and performs quantitative sensitivity analysis. During the meeting, the design team explores the global design space by filtering the thousands of simulations. Variable filter criteria are easily applied using an interactive parallel coordinate plot which provide immediate feedback on requirements and design choices. Sensitivity measures and metamodels show the combined effects of changing a single input and how to remedy unwanted output changes.

The outline intermittently employs simulation models and global sensitivity analysis methods in order to facilitate the acquisition of system-related knowledge throughout the iterations. Moreover, the decision maker participates in the decision making process by interactively adjusting control variables and system parameters according to a guiding analysis question posed for each iteration. As a result, the overall decision making process is backed up by sensitivity analysis results providing increased confidence in terms of reliability of considered decision alternatives. Using the efficiency concept of Pareto optimality and the sensitivity analysis method of Sobol’ sensitivity indices, the methodology is then instantiated in a case study on planning and deciding in an infectious disease epidemic situation similar to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Results show that the presented simulation-based methodology is capable of successfully addressing issues such as system dynamics, parameter uncertainty, and multi-criteria decision making.

The model is based on the analysis of results of MDM methods, that is, the analysis of changes in rankings of MDM methods that occur as a result of alterations in input parameters. In the recommended model, we examine sensitivity analysis of MDM methods to changes in criteria weight and result consistency of methods to changes in measurement scale and the way in which we formulate criteria. In the final phase of the model, we select the most suitable method to solve the observed problem and the optimal alternative. The model is tested on an example, when the optimal MDM method selection was required in order to determine the location of the logistical center. During the selection process, TOPSIS, COPRAS, VIKOR and ELECTRE methods were considered. VIKOR method demonstrated the biggest stability of rankings and was selected as the most fit method for ranking the locations of the logistical center. Results of the demonstrated analysis indicate sensitivity of standard MDM methods to criteria considered in this work. Therefore, it is necessary, to take into account stability of the considered method during the selection process of the optimal method.},

   abstract = {Selecting the most suitable mineral processing equipment among feasible alternatives with respect to multiple conflicting criteria is considered a Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. For example, a type of crusher that might allow a very high throughput is less likely to be used in a mobile plant, so trade-offs between these type of criteria need to be clearly defined in the decision making process. One of the most frequently used MCDM methods is the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, which relies on judgements from decision makers that allow for comparisons to be made between alternatives (e.g. the type of equipment) or criteria (e.g. the characteristics of the equipment that are of interest). However, AHP is not able to capture the uncertainty associated with the various decision makers’ judgements and the lack of precise information. An integrated constrained fuzzy stochastic analytic hierarchy process (IC-FSAHP) is a new hybrid MCDM method that can be used to overcome the aforementioned limitations of AHP. In order to understand the robustness of AHP based methods, a sensitivity analysis of the decision making results is required. However, sensitivity analyses are not often carried out for fuzzy AHP methods, arguably because of the complexity of some of the procedures involved, the computation time required and the limited resources available to do so. The main objective of this paper is therefore to propose a new sensitivity analysis approach by applying an additional fuzzification factor and disagreement level of decision makers in order to model uncertainty. For this purpose, a case study for the selection of primary crushers was considered. Five types of primary crushers were evaluated with respect to six criteria to showcase the applicability of the proposed approach to assess IC-FSAHP. The results obtained showcase that the proposed sensitivity analysis approach is capable of providing extensive and useful “what-if” information on the decision making results.},

In particular, a simple data normalization technique is illustrated using Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), and a linear technique using the VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method. There are five criteria used, obtained from observation through measurements and a questionnaire from 400 students. The confusion matrix testing method is used to measure the value of data sensitivity, which includes precision, accuracy and error rate. The results of the study obtained data analysis sensitivity for each method shows that the distribution of normalized data in the selection of 10% (40 students) of positive target recipients, the sensitivity of the linear technique (Vikor method) is higher than the simple technique (SAW method). However, for the target of 15% (60 students) the simple method is higher. The results show that each data normalization technique for decision-making analysis has a different sensitivity value in terms of social assistance for target groups, although many studies suggest that certain methods may be better than others.},

However, human beings still suffer from knee‐joint‐related problems such as aseptic loosening caused by excessive wear between articular surfaces, stress‐shielding of the bone by prosthesis, and soft tissue development in the interface of bone and implant due to inappropriate selection of TKR material. The choice of most suitable materials for the femoral component of TKR is a critical decision; therefore, in this research paper, a hybrid multiple‐criteria decision‐making (MCDM) tactic is applied using the degree of membership (DoM) technique with a varied system, using the weighted sum method (WSM), the weighted product method (WPM), the weighted aggregated sum product assessment method (WASPAS), an evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS), and a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOP‐ SIS). The weights of importance are assigned to different criteria by the equal weights method (EWM). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is conducted to check the solidity of the projected tactic. The weights of importance are varied using the entropy weights technique (EWT) and the standard deviation method (SDM). The projected hybrid MCDM methodology is simple, reliable and valua-ble for a conflicting decision‐making environment.},

   abstract = {Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is one of the support techniques for Health Technology Assessment (HTA). A typical method is the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The output of TOPSIS presents an order of alternatives. A significant risk may be posed by an inappropriate setup of the weights of the criteria such that a very small deviation from the proper value could substantially change the final result. Sensitivity analysis is a method for testing changes of the final order by a modification of the original input data or by small deviation of the original weights of the criteria. This original approach is very slow and computationally demanding in the case of a change of the value of any attribute. The newly proposed method is significantly faster, making it possible to change of the values of the weights by only a few computations within TOPSIS. In the first stage, TOPSIS is used to compute the values of the Positive and Negative Ideal Solutions (PIS and NIS), and sensitivity analysis is only performed for the changed weights in the next stage. In the proposed method, a weight is adjusted (and the other weights recalculated) in order to find a range where the order of the alternatives remains unchanged for the modified weights. The weight adjustment can have the form of a fixed change or of an iterative process approximating the stability range for the weight. The new method is fast and simple to implement, providing a robust output of TOPSIS and pointing out a possible wrong setup of the initial weight(s).},

   abstract = {In 2014, the government of the state of Indian Punjab amended its existing system of public distribution of food grains by launching the “new atta-daal (wheat-pulses) scheme”. Instead of distributing subsidized food grains monthly to its underprivileged citizens, the state started distributing grains on a biannual basis (i.e., every 6 months). The state claims that the new system yields logistical and monetary benefits that favour the state treasury; however, beneficiaries have voiced concerns regarding grain handling and one-time payments. To achieve a beneficial outcome for multiple stakeholders with conflicting objectives, a formal analysis of different policy alternatives is necessary. This research paper applies multi-criteria decision analysis to evaluate alternative public grain distribution schemes for the district of Ludhiana in Indian Punjab. First, an objectives hierarchy and measures for the decision problem were developed using emergent codes from qualitative data collected via semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and guided conversations with 40 participants representing eight different stakeholders. Using the rank-order method, weights were then assessed to identify the relative importance of these measures. Five feasible grain distribution policy alternatives were generated, and data describing the performance of these alternatives with respect to each measure were collected via Likert scale surveys of over 300 beneficiary households across 14 different villages (rural) and localities (urban) of Ludhiana district in Punjab. Value functions were assigned to each measure to identify the best performing alternative, and sensitivity analysis was performed to establish the robustness of the final solution. Overall, beneficiaries preferred a 6-monthly distribution system with improvements, such as better communication and disciplined distribution.},

The aim of this paper is to propose a methodological framework allowing for the readjustment of trade-offs among risk evaluation criteria, considered of extreme importance in the lending decision process of mortgage loans. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has proved over the years to be effective and versatile in handling compensations among criteria. Measuring attractiveness is applied by a categorical based evaluation technique (MACBETH) to a pre-established structure of credit-scoring criteria for mortgage lending risk evaluation. This pre-established structure is currently used by one of the largest banks in Portugal. Findings: The framework allowed the authors to provide the credit experts who participated in the study with a more informed, transparent and accurate mortgage-lending risk-evaluation system. The sensitivity and robustness analyses carried out also helped in promoting discussion and supporting the readjustments made. Research limitations/implications: The study shows the usefulness of using the MACBETH approach to assist credit analysts in making better informed decisions, and opens avenues for further research. However, due to the dependence on the participants involved, extrapolations without proper caution are discouraged. Practical implications: The credit analysts who participated in this study considered the framework more discerning in terms of Basel directives.

   abstract = {Purpose The formulary inclusion of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the government hospital health services in Qatar is not comparative or restricted. Requests to include a PPI in the formulary are typically accepted if evidence of efficacy and tolerability is presented. There are no literature reports of a PPI scoring model that is based on comparatively weighted multiple indications and no reports of PPI selection in Qatar or the Middle East. This study aims to compare first-line use of the PPIs that exist in Qatar. The economic effect of the study recommendations was also quantified. Methods A comparative, evidence-based multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model was constructed to follow the multiple indications and pharmacotherapeutic criteria of PPIs. Literature and an expert panel informed the selection criteria of PPIs. Input from the relevant local clinician population steered the relative weighting of selection criteria. Comparatively scored PPIs, exceeding a defined score threshold, were recommended for selection. Findings Weighted model scores were successfully developed, with 95% CI and 5% margin of error. The model comprised 7 main criteria and 38 subcriteria. Main criteria are indication, dosage frequency, treatment duration, best published evidence, available formulations, drug interactions, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Most weight was achieved for the indications selection criteria. Esomeprazole and rabeprazole were suggested as formulary options, followed by lansoprazole for nonformulary use. The estimated effect of the study recommendations was up to a 15.3% reduction in the annual PPI expenditure. Robustness of study conclusions against variabilities in study inputs was confirmed via sensitivity analyses. Implications The implementation of a locally developed PPI-specific comparative MCDA scoring model, which is multiweighted indication and criteria based, into the Qatari formulary selection practices is a successful evidence-based cost-cutting exercise. Esomeprazole and rabeprazole should be the first-line choice from among the PPIs available at the Qatari government hospital health services.},

   abstract = {Decision-making in environmental management requires eliciting preferences of stakeholders and predicting outcomes of decision alternatives. Usually, preferences and predictions are both uncertain. Uncertainty of predictions can be tackled by multi-attribute utility theory, but the uncertainty of preferences remains a challenge. We demonstrate an approach for including both uncertainties in a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), using utility theory and the concept of expected expected utility. For a decision regarding a regional merger of wastewater infrastructure in Switzerland, we constructed preference models for four stakeholders. These models also allowed for non-additive interactions between objectives. We evaluated the performance of eleven decision alternatives for which we predicted potential outcomes. Even though uncertainties were high, we could draw conclusions based on the expected expected utility of alternatives. Building a pipeline to discharge treated wastewater to a larger river emerged as a potential consensus alternative to mitigate the problem of micropollutants in a small stream. We investigated the robustness of the findings with sensitivity analysis regarding the preference parameters and the included objectives. In their actual decision, the stakeholders partly preferred other alternatives than those proposed by the model. Their choices could be explained by reduced decision models in which only few objectives were included. This may indicate the use of simplified choice heuristics by the stakeholders. The presented approach is feasible for supporting other difficult environmental or engineering decisions in practice, for which we give a number of recommendations.},

   abstract = {The evaluation and selection process can be regarded as a complex multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem which involves various interaction relationships among criteria under high uncertain environment. In addition, the decision-makers are always bounded rational in the risk decision-making process. However, the current robot evaluation and selection approach seldom considers the decision-maker's risk preference and interactive criteria under high uncertain environment. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to develop a hybrid MCDA approach for solving the robot evaluation and selection problem. In the proposed framework, the interval type-2 fuzzy set is used to express the uncertain evaluation information provided by decision-makers. Next, the distance measure of interval type-2 fuzzy numbers is developed to determine the fuzzy measure of each criterion.

   abstract = {The shorelines frequently suffer adverse impacts from oil spill accidents. As one important technique of shoreline cleanup, the application of surface washing agents (SWAs) can help achieve high oil removal from shoreline substrates with less damage to affected zone. In this study, a framework for evaluation and selection of SWAs in oil spill incidents was constructed to better understand and apply this technique. A decision tree was firstly developed to illustrate all possible scenarios which are appropriate to use SWAs in consideration of oil collectability, shoreline character, types and amount of stranded oil, and cleanup requirement. Based on literature review, theoretical modeling, and experts’ suggestions, an integrated multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method was then come up to select the most preferred SWA from five aspects of toxicity, effectiveness, minimal dispersion, demonstrated field test, and cost. Its suitability and rationality were proved by a hypothetical case. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed by changing the weight of each criterion independently to check the priority rank of alternatives, and it also verified the robustness and stability of this model. The presented framework has significant implications for future research and application of SWAs in the shoreline cleanup.},

Method This study is a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) using a model that includes three dimensions and nine criteria. Both the overall and individual scores of the respective targeted therapies in different dimensions and criteria were calculated. A sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to evaluate the robustness of the research results. An interview-based questionnaire survey was applied to obtain the performance information for the targeted therapies and the weights of the dimensions and criteria. Results Overall, the clinical dimension had the highest weight, followed by the economic dimension, and finally, the social dimension. In the clinical dimension, the “comparative efficacy” criterion had the highest weight; in the economic dimension, the “cost-effectiveness” criterion” was given the greatest importance; in the social dimension, the “social concern and patient needs” criterion was given more emphasis. The overall values ranked from high to low as follows: cetuximab (overall score 3.3666), bevacizumab (3.3043), panitumumab (3.2030), aflibercept (2.8923) and regorafenib (2.8366). Conclusions A comprehensive value assessment system combining “multi-dimensional criteria,” “multi-perspectives,” and an “integrative assessment” is necessary to evaluate the value of medicines. The results showed not only the order of weights of different dimensions or criteria, but also the rankings of the value of the targeted therapies.},

We designed a benefit-risk and cost assessment of oral anticoagulants. Design We followed the roadmap proposed by IMI-PROTECT and the considerations of emerged good practice to perform Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The roadmap defines the following steps: (1) planning, (2) evidence gathering and data preparation, (3) analyses, (4) explorations, and (5) conclusions. We defined two reference points (0–100) to allocate numerical values for scores and weights, and used an analogue numeric scale to assess physicians’ preferences. As benefits of the anticoagulant therapy, we included reductions in stroke and all-cause mortality; intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, minor bleeding and myocardial infarction were considered risks. We also made an estimation of the annual drug cost per person. Main results The scores were: Apixaban 33, Dabigatrán 25, warfarin 18 and Rivaroxaban 14 this score reveals the most preferred up to the less preferred option, considering the benefit-risk ratio and drug costs altogether. The relative model weights were: 51.1% for risks, 40.4% for benefits and 8.5% for cost. The sensitivity analysis confirms the model robustness. Conclusions From this analysis, apixaban should be considered as the preferred anticoagulant option -due to a better benefit-risk balance and a minor cost influence- followed by dabigatran, warfarin and rivaroxaban.},

Although an attractive goal to most, executives face difficulties in implementing; sustainable manufacturing due to the necessity of balancing social, economic and environmental; outcomes associated with the implementation of different manufacturing alternatives and; processes. This is especially true in highly competitive consumer-oriented industries, such as the automotive industry. The literature review presented herein indicated that most of the available sustainability frameworks are qualitative in nature and limited to discussion of sustainable materials and processes, while tradeoffs between the environmental, social and economic domains of sustainability are rarely examined. To overcome such shortcomings, we develop a quantitative framework for sustainable manufacturing and illustrate its application for the automotive industry. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is utilized to combine the values of industry executives and decision makers with performance criteria of different car manufacturing materials (ferrous metals, aluminum, plastics, organic composites, and synthetic composites). Our results show how material alternatives in manufacturing can be quantitatively selected based on sustainability objectives. Additionally, we illustrate how sensitivity analyses are used to assess the robustness of the resulting alternative selection. Although this framework may be useful for decision makers in its current form, future applications might improve the model by choosing different or more specific alternatives, using objective performance scores supported by industry research, or by investigating a more diverse set of weight distributions representing dissimilar stakeholder values.},

Preemptive measures are needed for dealing with mutable risks and vulnerabilities to safeguard robust supply chain systems. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) connotes a set of risk management responses essentially instigated to confront supply chain risks. As supply chain risks are intertwined, one resilient strategy for risk mitigation can moderate several supply chain risks. A complex decision making problem involving twelve major supply chain risks and twenty one resilient strategies for risk mitigation have been acknowledged in this research with archetypal focus on electronics manufacturing supply chains. A combination of Multi criteria decision aid (MCDA) and artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in decision making of complex real world problems. A decision support model incorporating an amalgamation of grey theory and layered analytic network process (ANP) has been employed for quantifying various resilient strategies for risk mitigation. The proposed model was also applied in a practical setting taking a case study of an electronics manufacturing company. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to ensure the robustness of obtained results. The combined methodology proposed in this research could be effectively used by top management, to pigeonhole the resilient supply chain strategies for better managing their supply chains.},

   abstract = {This research analyses the application of spatially explicit sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for GIS (Geographic Information System) multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) within a multi-dimensional vulnerability assessment regarding flooding in the Salzach river catchment in Austria. The research methodology is based on a spatially explicit sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of GIS-CDA for an assessment of the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of vulnerability. The main objective of this research is to demonstrate how a unified approach of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis can be applied to minimise the associated uncertainty within each dimension of the vulnerability assessment. The methodology proposed for achieving this objective is composed of four main steps. The first step is computing criteria weights using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). In the second step, Monte Carlo simulation is applied to calculate the uncertainties associated with AHP weights. In the third step, the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is employed in the form of a model-independent method of output variance decomposition, in which the variability of the different vulnerability assessments is apportioned to every criterion weight, generating one first-order (S) and one total effect (ST) sensitivity index map per criterion weight. Finally, in the fourth step, an ordered weighted averaging method is applied to model the final vulnerability maps. The results of this research demonstrate the robustness of spatially explicit GSA for minimising the uncertainty associated with GIS-MCDA models. Based on these results, we conclude that applying the variance-based GSA enables assessment of the importance of each input factor for the results of the GIS-MCDA method, both spatially and statistically, thus allowing us to introduce and recommend GIS-based GSA as a useful methodology for minimising the uncertainty of GIS-MCDA.},

   abstract = {Globally, the pandemic of COVID-19 has penetrated all spheres of human endeavors, and noteworthy is the tremendous increase in the volume of healthcare wastes generated in Nigeria. There has been an increase in medical waste materials produced as a result of the extensive use of both disposable personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face shields and nose and face masks, and highly infectious waste materials, such as contaminated syringes, needles, and soiled bandages from diagnosed positive cases. Despite the huge volume in waste generation, a standardized evaluation framework is currently lacking in the management of medical wastes in Nigeria. This study has developed a novel assessment framework for managing medical wastes, which is curated from the technical guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO). The applicability of the framework was examined on seven designated public and private-owned hospitals in Ota. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approaches of multi-criteria decision analysis were utilized in modelling an evaluation framework for the objective of medical waste management. Carefully designed interview questionnaires, observations, and site visits were carried out to obtain data from healthcare professionals in Ota. Results show that waste segregation was practiced more decisively in private hospitals than public hospitals. Waste segregation is established as a key determinant in implementing an effective waste management system in any healthcare facility. The success of waste segregation in healthcare institutions is highly dependent on good hospital management, organizational policies, efficient budget planning for waste management, and the operational running cost. Disposal methods investigated were mostly open burning and incessant dumping for most public health care centers. Deficient waste management practices were observed in waste disposal, waste transportation, storage, and organizational policies. While the awareness and capacity building on occupational safety practices and environmental public health is widely known by health workers and waste handlers, compliance and enforcement are critical challenges. The validation of results using fuzzy TOPSIS and a sensitivity analysis shows a high degree of the consistency, stability, and robustness of the model. Findings from the present study can aid decision making, as this will benefit policy makers and key stakeholders in developing more comprehensive and effective medical waste management guidelines in Nigeria. In addition, future decision-making studies could augment the results from the current research by assessing the impact of the pandemic preparedness and response on medical waste management.},

Urban vulnerability is a major issue which arises in urban management, and is simply defined as how vulnerable various structures in a city are to different hazards. Reducing urban vulnerability and enhancing resilience are considered to be essential steps towards achieving urban sustainability. To date, a vast body of literature has focused on investigating urban systems' vulnerabilities with regard to natural hazards. However, less attention has been paid to vulnerabilities resulting from man-made hazards. This study proposes to investigate the physical vulnerability of buildings in District 6 of Tehran, Iran, with respect to intentional explosion hazards. A total of 14 vulnerability criteria are identified according to the opinions of various experts, and standard maps for each of these criteria have been generated in a GIS environment. Ultimately, an ordered weighted averaging (OWA) technique was applied to generate vulnerability maps for different risk conditions. The results of the present study indicate that only about 25 percent of buildings in the study area have a low level of vulnerability under moderate risk conditions. Sensitivity analysis further illustrates the robustness of the results obtained. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing that local authorities must focus more on risk-reduction techniques in order to reduce physical vulnerability and achieve urban sustainability.},

This paper provides guidance on making decisions in fruit growing when there are multiple criteria. All criteria are divided into two groups: economic and technical criteria. The economic criteria are further divided into three subcriteria, namely: marketing costs, orchard construction costs and processing and transport costs. Technical criteria are divided into four subcriteria, namely: fruit, variety resistance, production characteristics and processing and transport. According to these, a multicriteria decision-making model based on linguistic values was created. In order to take advantage of these values, a fuzzy approach was applied. Using this approach, decision-making process is easier because decision making is tailored to human thinking. For the example of raising a new orchard in the area of Semberija, an evaluation of seven different varieties of pears was performed. This problem is solved by applying the method of multicriteria analysis (MCDA). To solve this research problem, the MABAC (Multi-attributive border approximation area comparison) method was used. Using the fuzzy MABAC method, the obtained results show that the Šampionka variety has the best indicators among observed varieties. In addition, the Konferans variety achieved good results, and these two varieties are the first choice for raising a new orchard of pears. The paper validates the results and performs sensitivity analysis. The contribution of this research is to develop a new model of decision making by using a new methodology that facilitates decision making on variety selection. This model and methodology provide a flexible way of making decisions in fruit growing.},

   abstract = {The focus of this study was to carry out an evaluation of solid waste disposal site selection in the city Aräk of Iran. Based on published information, different methods have been applied to address this problem, among which Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has been found to be a fruitful approach. Owing to the imprecision in the objective and subjective factors affecting the problem, for tackling the uncertainty and imprecision in human behavior, in this paper a new fuzzy MCDA approach is applied in an intelligible manner to construct the real decision matrix. Fuzzy Multicriteria Hierarchy Process (FMHP) and ELECTRE methods are the two successive steps employed to cope with imprecision in the assessment of the criteria and alternatives to select the best site. Given a fuzzy judgment matrix, FMHP produces a real decision matrix that is applied as an input for ELECTRE to build outranking relations among the actions. The integration of FMHP and ELECTRE considers both the fuzziness and partiality of the factors affecting site selection problem into account and avoids compensatory offsets between several criteria with weak and strong values. Finally, the conducted sensitivity analysis indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method as an instrumented decision support model. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

They shared common principles and values, such as customer collaboration, early and continuous delivery of releases, accept requirements changing, and other common principles advocated by the agile manifesto since 2001. Meanwhile, there are significant differences among the practices adopted by the agile methods to fulfill agility's principles and values. The differences could be interpreted in terms of how an agile method judges the relative importance of such principles or its orientation to a specific project viewpoint (organizational, technical, or conceptual) rather than others. This fact leads to a necessity of a deep evaluation of agile methods to choose the best-fit method suited for a project. Moreover, vague and uncertain information used to evaluate those lightweight methodologies could represent an additional difficulty for decision makers (DM). To drawback this problem, the multiple criteria decision aid (MCDA) method fuzzy PROMETHEE is proposed to assess agile methods with regard to different conflicting criteria and handling besides uncertainty in decision making. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is provided to validate results and verify their stability.},

   abstract = {Thus far, limited research has been performed on resilient supplier selection—a problem that requires simultaneous consideration of a set of numerical and linguistic evaluation criteria, which are substantially different from traditional supplier selection problem. Essentially, resilient supplier selection entails key sourcing decision for an organization to gain competitive advantage. In the presence of multiple conflicting evaluation criteria, contradicting decision makers, and imprecise decision-relevant information (DRI), this problem becomes even more difficult to solve with the classical optimization approaches. Possibility distribution-based multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a viable alternative approach for handling inherent uncertainty of imprecise DRI associated with the evaluation offered by a group of contradicting decision makers. However, prior research focusing on MCDA-based supplier selection problem has been lacking in the ability to provide a seamless integration of numerical and linguistic evaluation criteria along with the consideration of multiple decision makers. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive decision-making framework for ranking a set of suppliers from resiliency perspective. The proposed algorithm is capable of leveraging imprecise and aggregated DRI obtained from crisp numerical assessments and reliability adjusted linguistic appraisals from a group of decision makers. We adapt two popular tools—single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNS) and interval-valued fuzzy sets (IVFS)—and for the first time, extend them to incorporate both crisp and linguistic evaluations in a group decision-making platform to obtain aggregated SVNS and IVFS decision matrixes. This information is then used to rank the resilient suppliers by using technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method. We present a case study to illustrate the mechanism of the proposed algorithm. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the strength of the proposed algorithm to generate alternative ranking scheme with respect to the shifting priorities of evaluation criteria and shows the reliability of the decision-making framework.},

As a transboundary animal disease, the prevention and control of FMD are important. This study was based on spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to assess FMD risk areas in mainland China. Ten risk factors were identified for constructing risk maps by scoring, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to calculate the criteria weights of all factors. Different risk factors had different units and attributes, and fuzzy membership was used to standardize the risk factors. The weighted linear combination (WLC) and one-at-a-time (OAT) were used to obtain risk and uncertainty maps as well as to perform sensitivity analysis. Results: Four major risk areas were identified in mainland China, including western (parts of Xinjiang and Tibet), southern (parts of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Sichuan and Guangdong), northern (parts of Gansu, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia), and eastern (parts of Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong). Spring is the main season for FMD outbreaks. Risk areas were associated with the distance to previous outbreak points, grazing areas and cattle density. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the risk map had good predictive power (AUC=0.8634). Conclusions: These results can be used to delineate FMD risk areas in mainland China, and veterinary services can adopt the targeted preventive measures and control strategies.},

A collective methodology of Geographic Information System-Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) and the Fuzzy-DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) is presented. After implementing the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and two-way sensitivity analysis, we accomplish the most suitable biomass plants’ locations. The developed web-based tool framing the collective method targets and generates Multi-Criteria-Spatial Decision Support System (MC-SDSS). Precisely, four main sections are described as general overview, MC-SDSS, two-way sensitivity analysis, and final result section for the LSABP. In final result section, users particularly test the location suitability option for five biomass plants with the chosen criteria. The results confirm that the suitable locations of biomass plants are situated near forests and in zones with low transport costs, which comprise only 9.25% highly suitable area. Five plants are not located in the highly suitable areas. The most influential criteria of the LSABP are the vegetation cover, agricultural area, transport cost, and potential demand criteria. By assessing diverse alternatives, the LSABP assists certain decisions for adjusting and analyzing the setting of biomass facilities on a strategic, tactical, and operational level. Therefore, this work demonstrates the novelty of framework development as a cleaner production for integrating globally accessible spatial and environmental algorithms and datasets in computing with newly designed and implemented an interactive web-based tool for the evaluation purpose of various personal and government levels.

Many indicators in maternal health care have improved significantly, but the speed and magnitude of changes have varied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dynamic changes in China’s maternal health status from 2004 to 2018, in order to determine whether China’s medical and health reform measures in recent years have improved maternal health. A total of 6 evaluation indicators from the data of China Health Statistics Yearbook 2019 were selected. Then, based on the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDA) methodology, the entropy weighted technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), entropy weighted rank-sum ratio (RSR) method and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation were employed in this study. In addition, sensitivity analysis was engaged to validate the stability and accuracy of the achieved results. The study results shows the ranking values of various methods were not exactly the same, but the overall trend was consistent. Overall, the maternal health care in China improved from 2004 to 2018 year by year, of which the top four were ranked from 2015 to 2018, and relatively poor from 2004 to 2006. This means that the policies and measures implemented in China’s medical and health reform in the past few decades have effectively promoted China’s maternal health care, and this will also provide a theoretical basis for future decisions to promote maternal health care.},

The study provides an integrated framework with a focus on structuring the decision‐making process for the landfill suitability site map. This could be determined by the use of proper data collection, criterion weighting and normalization. In order to understand the procedures that affect the suitability of landfill sites, the integrated GIS‐based fuzzy‐AHP‐MCDA method was implemented to appropriate landfill site for Ab-ha‐Khamis‐Mushyet located in Aseer region Following the extensive literature review and expert opinion, 10 themes were selected for this study such as drainage density, land use/land cover (LULC), slope, elevation, lineament density, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rain-fall, distance from the airport, distance from road, and geology. These themes have been developed through RS (remote sensing) and conventional data. Subsequently, potential landfill sites were identified and divided into five classes: very low suitable (fuzzy value 0.20–0.45), low suitable (0.46–0.55), moderately suitable (0.56–0.65), high suitable (0.66–0.75), and very high suitable (0.76– 0.92). According to the statistical analysis, 23.91% and 3.67% of the total area were within a very good and good landfill area, while 38.14% and 22.84% accounted for the moderate and poor suitable zone, respectively. As a quality‐based site, the existing two landfill sites were located over a very low suitable and low suitable potential area while one landfill site was located over the high suitable∙ The spatial variance of high and very high potential landfill site zones found in the north‐eastern, east‐central and south‐eastern parts of the watershed. The sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the efficacy of each parameter and reveals that the effective weights for each theme differ slightly from the theoretical weight assigned to the landfill site suitability zone. This technique and its findings can provide an appropriate guideline to assist hydrogeologists, engineers, regional planners, and decision‐makers in selecting an optimal landfill site in the future.},

   abstract = {Facing water scarcity conditions water utilities cannot longer tolerate inefficiencies in their water systems. To guarantee sustainable water management one central task is reducing water losses from the supply systems. There are numerous challenges in managing water losses, manifested in a variety of options, their complexities, multiple evaluation criteria, inherent uncertainties and the conflicting objectives and interests of different stakeholders. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches for decision support in this complex topic. The study covers identifying the key options among a set of options that have been proposed within a framework of strategies to reduce water losses in water distribution systems of developing countries. The proposed methodology was initiated by developing a hierarchical structure of the decision problem that consists of four levels: Overall objective, main criteria, evaluation criteria and options. Different stakeholders were engaged in the process of structuring and evaluating the decision problem. An integrated methodology that combines fuzzy set theory with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods was then employed. This methodology has the potential to transform qualitative data into equivalent quantitative measures. Fuzzy AHP was used to create weights for main and evaluation criteria, while Fuzzy TOPSIS was used to aid the ranking of options in terms of their potential to meet the overall objective based on the evaluations and preferences of decision makers. The results showed that pressure management and control strategy was the most prevalent one, followed by employing advanced techniques and establishment of district metered areas. Their dominance was highly connected to the local and boundary conditions of the case study. The sensitivity analysis results showed that strongest and weakest options were less sensitive to changes in weights of evaluation criteria, which could be attributed to the strong consensus in strengthening the best option and neglecting the worst option. This study emphasized the successful application of MCDA in dealing with complicated issues in the context of water loss management. It is anticipated that, the integration of this developed framework in the planning policies of water utilities in developing countries can help in conducting better control over water losses.},

Therefore, the aim of this study is to select offshore wind farm locations in Poland, based on sustainability assessment, which is an inherent aspect of RES decision-making issues. To accomplish the objectives of this research, PROSA (PROMETHEE for Sustainability Assessment) method, a new multi-criteria method is proposed.

However, PROSA is characterized by a lower degree of criteria compensation than PROMETHEE. Thus, it adheres in a higher degree to the strong sustainability paradigm. The study also compared the solutions of the decision problem obtained with the use of PROSA and PROMETHEE methods. The compared methods demonstrated a high concurrence of the recommended decision-making variant of location selection, from methodological and practical points of view. At the same time, the conducted research allowed to confirm that the PROSA method recommends more sustainable decision-making variants, and that the ranking it builds is less sensitive to changes in criteria weights. Therefore, it is more stable than the PROMETHEE-based ranking.},

Models for integrating ES and US with unexpressed and objective needs of defined groups of stakeholders may prove helpful for supporting decisions in landscape planning and manage-ment. In fact, they could be applied for highlighting landscape areas with different characteristics in terms of services provided. From this base, a suitability spatial assessment model (SUSAM) was developed and applied in a study area considering different verisimilar scenarios that policy makers could analyse. Each scenario is based on the prioritization of a set of services considering a defined group of stakeholders. Consistent and comparable ES and US indices of spatial benefiting areas (SBA) of services were calculated using GIS spatialization techniques. These indices were aggre-gated hierarchically with the relevance of services according to a spatial multicriteria decision analysis (S‐MCDA). Results include maps for each scenario showing detailed spatial indices of suitability that integrate the local availability of SBA of ES and US, along with their relevance. The results were compared with known landscape classes identified in previous studies, which made it possible to interpret the spatial variation of suitability in the light of known landscape features. A complete sensitivity analysis was performed to test the sensitiveness of the model’s outputs to variations of judgements and their resistance to the indicators’ variation. The application of the model demonstrated its effectiveness in a landscape suitability assessment. At the same time, the sensitivity analysis and helping to understand the model behaviour in the different landscape classes also suggested possible solutions for simplifying the whole methodology.},

   abstract = {Objectives: The Centre for Public Health (CPH), at the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is responsible for producing national guidance relating to the promotion of good health and the prevention and treatment of disease. Given the challenges of developing guidance in this area, choosing the most appropriate topics for further study is of fundamental importance. This paper explores the current prioritisation process and describes how the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique, might be used to do so. Study design: A proposed approach is outlined, which was tested in a proof of concept pilot. This consisted of eight participants with experience of related NICE committees building scores for each topic together in a 'decision conference' setting. Methods: Criteria were identified and subsequently weighted to indicate the relative importance of each. Participants then collaboratively estimated the performance of each topic on each criterion. Results: Total scores for each topic were calculated, which could be ranked and used as the basis for better informed discussion for prioritising topics to recommend to the Minister for future guidance. Sensitivity analyses of the dataset found it to be robust. Conclusions: Choosing the right topics for guidance at the earliest possible time is of fundamental importance to public health guidance, and judgement is likely to play an important part in doing so. MCDA techniques offer a potentially useful approach to structuring the problem in a rational and transparent way. NICE should consider carefully whether such an approach might be worth pursuing in the future.},

   abstract = {The selection of a best alternative method to minimize air pollution and energy consumption for mine sites is a critical task because it encompasses evaluation of different techniques. The aim of this paper is to select most suitable technology for mining system which helps in reducing air pollution and carbon footprints by implementing the multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. The existing methods or frameworks in the mining sector, which have been used in the past to select the sustainable solution, are lacking aid of MCDA, and there is a need to contribute more in this field with a promising decision system. The MCDA method is applied as a probabilistic integrated approach for a mine site in Canada. The analysis involves processing inputs to the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) method which assists in identifying the alternatives, defining the criteria, and thus outranking of the final choice. Moreover, criteria weighting has been determined using analytical hierarchical process (AHP) method. Three categories: reduction of dust/fugitive emission control strategies, reduction in fuel consumption to minimize carbon footprint, and cyanide destruction methods are selected. The probability distributions of criteria weights and output flows are defined by performing uncertainty analysis using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The sensitivity analysis is conducted using Spearman’s rank correlation method and walking criteria weights. The results indicate that the integrated framework provides a reliable way of selecting air pollution control solutions and help in quantifying the impact of different criteria for the selected alternatives.},

Problem structuring, a crucial stage for the outcomes, includes identifying objec-tives, selecting scenarios within the analysis period, defining problem alternatives, and defining the problematic type. Problem evaluation includes the selection of assessment metrics, selection of the aggregation method, application of the method, and a sensitivity and robustness analysis. Two scenarios, nine assessment metrics, and seven alternatives are established, and two ranking methods (the additive model and ELECTRE III method) are used to compare the alternatives. The results show that the best solution corresponds to building a new pipe and deactivating the existing one, as it significantly reduces the pipe failure risk and O&M costs, whereas the worst solution is always the status quo case, since it is the only alternative that does not improve the system performance, independently of the ranking method and the analyzed scenario.},

Among others, the proper siting and cost evaluation of such a solution constitutes sources of uncertainty for the implementation of MAR schemes. In this study, we proposed a methodology for the assessment of the levelised cost of recharged water through an infiltration basin, including investment and operating costs. The method was implemented in a GIS-tool in order to build maps of levelised costs at the aquifer scale. The sensitivity analysis allows for the identification of the main natural characteristics (water quality and availability, etc.), technical (system life duration, recharge volume objective, etc.), and economic parameters (energy price, discount rate, etc.) that dominate the final cost estimate. The method was applied to a specific case study on an alluvial aquifer in Southern France. This new information on the economic feasibility of MAR scheme should be incorporated with more classical GIS-MCDA (relying on soil characteristics, aquifer storage capacity, land use, etc.) in order to properly site the system. Further information on financial and economic feedback from MAR implementation and research on the fate of recharged water are needed for a better benefits evaluation of this solution.},

   abstract = {The use of reclaimed water as an alternative non-potable source is an increasing practice worldwide, especially in areas where water scarcity is becoming more severe. As with other environmental applications, reuse planning commonly faces a problem related to the selection of the best scheme to be adopted. To address this issue, this paper proposes, based on a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach, the development of the Water Reuse Potential (WRP) index to indicate the potential for developing industrial and agricultural non-potable water reuse schemes. The study area selected was the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP) in Brazil, a region that can be used as a model for most urban areas in the world. The model was built using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) applying technical, environmental, and socioeconomic criteria. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to verify the influence of criteria weights on the results. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used for data extraction and spatial allocation of the results. The study identified São Paulo (WRP ​= ​0.813), Suzano (0.363), Barueri (0.293), Mogi das Cruzes (0.282) and Guarulhos (0.252) as the municipalities with greater WRP. Considering that water reuse is not a common practice in many countries and that non-potable reuse may be a fundamental step for water sources diversification, the approach developed can be used as a planning tool to assess and classify any region according to its reuse potential, providing decision makers and planners with simple-understanding and versatile elements for prioritizing investments in further studies.},

Drivers and pedestrians are more likely to violate traffic regulations, and thus adversely affect traffic safety and flow, in streets that have many such crossings. Careful planning of pedestrian crossing locations provides a solution to these problems. In this study, a corridor-based analysis of such sites is performed. Twenty-four criteria that are considered to affect pedestrian crossing locations and traffic flow aredetermined. Based on these criteria, the most suitable pedestrian crossing scenario is identified using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (VIKOR) from Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods are used to evaluate the pedestrian crossing locations, and PTV VISSIM is used to examine the impact of these sites on traffic.

In the current study, a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is performed on four different WtE technologies viz anaerobic digestion, gasification, plasma arc gasification, and pyrolysis to identify the alternative with the most techno-economic advantage for investment in Ghana. The goal of the current study is achieved using a fuzzy TOPSIS approach. Five academic and field experts were employed to judge all four alternatives according to ten selected techno-economic criteria. The present study reveals that for all the alternatives under consideration, the most feasible WtE technology for investment in Ghana follows the order; gasification > anaerobic digestion > pyrolysis > plasma arc gasification. The most influential technical and economic criteria are energy generation per annum and initial investment, respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows a high degree of consistency, robustness, and stability in the obtained results. The current work recommends that the integration of anaerobic digestion and gasification should be promoted as it has the potential to offer a well-balanced WtE technology under both technical and economic conditions compared to the stand-alone systems. Findings from the current study could ease the decision-making of potential WtE technology investors in Ghana.},

To solve such problems, decision systems based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods are usually used. Unfortunately, most methods assume independence between the criteria, therefore, their application in decision problems related to the wind energy is debatable. This paper presents the use of the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method to solve a decision problem consisting in selecting the location and design of a wind farm. The use of the ANP method allows capturing the complexity of the decision problem by taking into consideration dependencies between criteria. As part of the verification of the solution, the results of the ANP method were compared with those of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, which uses only hierarchical dependencies between criteria. The conducted verification showed that the inter-criteria dependencies may have a significant influence on the obtained solution. On the basis of the conducted sensitivity analysis and the research into robustness of the rankings to the rank reversal phenomenon, it has been found out that the ranking obtained with the use of the ANP is characterized by a higher quality than by means of the AHP.},

   abstract = {Context: The nonspecific storage symptom complex overactive bladder (OAB) is an important clinical condition in functional urology. Until recently, pharmacological therapy comprised antimuscarinic drugs, but more recently beta 3 agonists have added to the available agents. Traditional reporting of efficacy and safety of these agents relies upon regulatory placebo-controlled studies. There remains no head-to-head comparison of existing agents in the contemporary literature. Contemporary conclusions on comparative efficacy and safety drawn from the use of these agents are based on systematic reviews of the literature and associated meta-analyses. Objective: In this study, we used the analytical model of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare contemporary pharmacotherapy for OAB. Evidence acquisition: Efficacy and safety data from published, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of antimuscarinic antagonists, the beta 3 agonist, and the combination of an antimuscarinic and beta 3 agonist were used to populate the MCDA model. Evidence synthesis: Experts assessed weights of the relative importance of favourable and unfavourable effects, which provided a common measure of benefits and safety that were combined in the MCDA model to give an overall ranking of the OAB drugs. Results: When benefits are judged as more important than safety, fesoterodine 4 or 8 mg used in a flexible dosing pattern provides the most favourable therapeutic option, over a wide sensitivity analysis relating to benefits and harms. Conclusions: In our analysis using an MCDA model, in both the flexible dosing pattern of fesoterodine and the solifenacin combination with mirabegron, the benefit-safety balance is better in terms of benefits and/or safety than any of the other available OAB drugs. Caution in interpretation of the data has to be expressed as the fesoterodine data are based on a flexible dosing regimen, which adds an additional dimension of personalising therapy. Patient summary: Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition with a significant impact on the quality of life. Possible symptoms include the following: (1) urgency—a compelling desire to urinate, which is difficult to defer; (2) urgency urinary incontinence—urgency leading to incontinence episodes; (3) frequency—increased frequency of wanting to pass urine; and (4) nocturia—increase in instances of getting up at night to urinate. To date, the mainstay of therapy for OAB has been antimuscarinic drugs and, more recently, the beta 3 agonist mirabegron. Ten international experts in urology, obstetrics, gynaecology, healthy ageing, and data analysis compared the benefit-risk balance of 14 OAB drugs licensed in Europe. The experts considered the importance of a favourable effect on the above four symptoms and also potential for side effects, but only three of these side effects, constipation, dry mouth, and dizziness, showed clinically relevant differences among the six drugs they considered. The observations recorded here suggest interesting differences between drugs across a wide range of possible trade-offs between benefit and safety. The different recruitment criteria used for each study may influence the results seen, so they need to be treated with caution. Comparison of flexibly dosed fesoterodine studies with fixed-dose fesoterodine studies introduces an additional potential bias; definitive conclusions can be drawn only if enough comparable placebo-controlled flexible dosing studies with other drugs were available.},

To delineate the feasible MAR sites via a potential map, four steps were performed: problem definition, constraint mapping, suitability mapping, and sensitivity analysis. The results show that nearly 52% of the study area is suitable for installing MAR. Additionally, around 6% of the study area shows high potential for installing MAR, whereas nearly 20% falls under the moderate potential class. The potential map shows that the high-potential MAR sites are located at the western portion of the study area, near the ephemeral stream outlet.

This paper presents a framework to assess transportation performance measures and smart-growth of cities around the U.S. by including physical activity as one of the main criteria. Methods: This study employs Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. The proposed assessment framework is comprised of the evaluation of an individual criterion and the assessment of comprehensive results. The criteria are categorized into four groups including network performance, traffic safety, environmental impact, and physical activity. As a case example, the proposed performance measures were examined for forty-six cities in the U.S., and the required data was gathered from multiple sources. Results: The output of the framework contains sustainability and smart-growth rankings of the selected cities as well as uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis was utilized to determine the quantity that each performance measure or weighting factor requires to alter the smart-growth score. It has been illustrated that the dominancy between reversible pairs in the ranking is critically sensitive for almost 15% of cases. Conclusion: The results of the proposed framework can be an effective decision supporting tool in analyzing traffic management strategies. Results from the score sensitivity calculation indicate that the proposed framework can be adopted in multifaceted transportation system performance in sustainability and smart-growth of cities.},

Scenario and sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty in model designs and inputs. Results Fourteen criteria, covering clinical effectiveness, safety, and convenience of the treatments of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were identified. Exacerbations and device preloading were identified as the most important to patients; the least important was rescue medication use. Tiotropium's higher overall clinical effectiveness score was offset by aclidinium's better performance on safety and convenience outcomes. The MCDA generated a −42 (worst performance) to 100 (best performance) scale. The net impact of benefits over risks of aclidinium (38.5) exceeded that of tiotropium (13.2), and patients preferred aclidinium 79.7% of the time. Conclusions When considering clinical benefits and risks, aclidinium and tiotropium generate similar value to patients, but when convenience criteria are considered, aclidinium may be preferred. Further work is required to replicate these results, including eliciting preferences directly from patients.},

   abstract = {The decision on the selection of the best height-diameter ratio for the optimal design of oil storage tanks is a difficult task because there are so many criteria to be considered in selecting the most appropriate alternative. In this study, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was used by adopting Criteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation (CRITIC) in determining the objective weight of the criteria. The six criteria considered in this study are: Area occupied by the tank (m2), Weight (kg), Wind Moment (Nm), Seismic Ringwall Moment RWM (Nm), Base shear (N) and Estimated Cost (₦) and the objective weights assigned to them by CRITIC are 0.2356, 0.2607, 0.1238, 0.1249, 0.1196 and 0.1354, respectively. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was then used to rank each of the alternatives based on the objective weight obtained through CRITIC. The objective of obtaining an optimal design of a 13,000 m3 storage tank that will occupy less space, weighty to resist wind load and seismic overturning at a moderate (low) cost was achieved by Alternatives A4 and A5 (height-diameter ratios of 0.8 and 0.9). To validate the ranking result obtained by the TOPSIS method, another MCDA method, VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) was employed to compare the results. Validation of the TOPSIS method by VIKOR method revealed that there was high consistency in the results obtained, with a very high Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of 0.8727. Sensitivity analysis was also done to ascertain the robustness of the results.},

We integrate multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) results (LCA-MCDA) as a method of incorporating values of a hypothetical federal acquisition manager into the assessment of risks and benefits of emerging photovoltaic materials. Specifically, we compare adoption of copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) devices with molybdenum back contacts to alternative devices employing graphite or graphene instead of molybdenum. LCA impact results are interpreted alongside benefits of substitution including cost reductions and performance improvements through application of multi-attribute utility theory. To assess the role of uncertainty we apply Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis. We find that graphene or graphite back contacts outperform molybdenum under most scenarios and assumptions. The use of decision analysis clarifies potential advantages of adopting graphite as a back contact while emphasizing the importance of mitigating conventional impacts of graphene production processes if graphene is used in emerging CZTS devices. Our research further demonstrates that a combination of LCA and MCDA increases the usability of LCA in assessing product sustainability. In particular, this approach identifies the most influential assumptions and data gaps in the analysis and the areas in which either engineering controls or further data collection may be necessary.},

This study proposes an indifference thresholdbased attribute ratio analysis and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (ITARA-TOPSIS)-based assessment model to identify critical failure modes in products and systems. The improved indifference threshold-based attribute ratio analysis (ITARA) method can generate more reliable weights for risk factors. In addition, the modified technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is used to obtain the risk levels of the failure modes. The gray correlation coefficient is applied to replace the conventional Euclidean distance, and a new index is used to determine the priority of failure modes. The determination of risk factors is based on the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) theory, including severity, occurrence, and detection. An important indicator, the expected cost, is also included in the framework. The case of a steam turbine for a nuclear power plant is used to demonstrate the approach, and the analysis results show that the proposed model is practical and effective. Moreover, the advantages of our integrated model are illustrated through model comparisons and sensitivity analysis. This paper can help decision-makers, risk engineers, and related researchers to better understand how a systematic risk assessment can be conducted.},

   abstract = {Building a well-structured objectives hierarchy is central to multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). However, in the absence of a systematic methodology to support the process, this task has been described as “more art than science”. Objectives hierarchies often tend to become large and constraining the size of a hierarchy can be challenging. This paper proposes and illustrates the use of a set of methods to support the simplification of the hierarchies in contexts that are “data rich” and characterised by many objectives. The aim of using the proposed approach is to support decision analysts in developing an appropriately concise decision model for the further interactions with the stakeholders. Using data from two completed environmental cases we show retrospectively how qualitative (means-ends networks), semi-quantitative (relevancy analysis) and quantitative (correlation analysis, principal component analysis, local sensitivity analysis of weights) methods, used alone or in combination, can inform hierarchy development. We evaluate the potential benefits and challenges of each method and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the simplification of an objectives hierarchy. Questionnaire-based relevancy analysis can be a useful method to identify and communicate important objectives in the early phases of an MCDA process with stakeholders, while correlation analysis can help to identify overlapping objectives, particularly in cases having many objectives and alternatives. It is intended that the methods support a facilitator in developing a clear understanding of the problem and also prompt deeper thinking about and discussion of the appropriate structure and content of an objectives hierarchy with the stakeholders involved.},

This is a complex decision-making problem because multiple and conflicting criteria can contribute to the assessment. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques evaluate the trade-off between several quantitative and qualitative criteria and facilitate complex decision-making. This research introduces a framework based on MCDA to support pavement management decision making, while quantifying emerging sustainability-related factors such as safety, noise, and pollution in the decision-making process. The framework features include 1) identifying pavement management main decision elements: objectives, criteria, and attributes by detailing the problem with a five-level hierarchy structure; 2) employing combined analytic hierarchy process and multi-attribute utility theory to develop representative set of utility functions; and 3) ranking and prioritizing large networks of pavement sections while incorporating sustainability-related criteria. Data used to assess the decision criteria and develop the utility functions is extracted by means of a questionnaire survey completed by professionals working in the field of pavement management. The proposed method is applied to a case study consisting of ten pavement sections extracted from the long-term pavement performance database, wherein the sections are ranked based on their attributes. Sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of the different criteria on the ranking process. The proposed method has shown potential in ranking pavement networks based on the identified criteria. Future work can test the performance of the proposed methodology with a full-scale pavement network and apply it to other civil infrastructure assets to evaluate its performance with different types of projects.},

This paper presents a new planning approach to develop a reliable model identifying suitable to unsuitable sites for rural housing planning in Alange reservoir areas, Badajoz, Spain. The hybrid model presented herein is the combined application of the geographic information systems (GIS) and the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) with the fuzzy DEMATEL method in order to make rural housings' suitability map. The sixteen criteria were clustered into four groups, namely physical, natural, environmental and socio-economic group. The FDEMATEL participatory method was applied for groups/criteria weight coefficients calculation regarding with their influence and sensitivity on rural housings' development in reservoir areas under (mass) tourism. Total 146 respondents participated in the weighting process. With the aid of the weighted linear combination (WLC), the final rural housings' suitability map is evaluated for the study area reported on grading scale of 0–1, from least suitable areas to most suitable area. Here, it shows that 17.30% of Alange municipality has a most suitable area for rural housings' development after considering groups with stable sensitive analysis. The proposed methodology and the results, therefore, can be used for sustainable and resilient planning policy at all government levels in the decision-making process due to its flexible character. Thus, this approach could support to verify suitable housings’ sites in areas with similar geographical situations and conditions.},

   abstract = {The selection of the location of a biomass plant is a critical concern because biomass feedstocks are geographically and spatially dispersed. Geographic Information System-Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) techniques are powerful methods that have been applied to various disciplines using suitable criteria. These methods can be used to solve power planning problems, such as determining the optimal locations of biomass plants in the context of renewable energy. In response to the promotion of renewable energy in European strategy, Extremadura (Spain) is boosting energy generation from biomass as an alternative to traditional generation to protect the environment. This study presents a combined application of GIS-MCDA and the Fuzzy-DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) technique to identify suitable and favorable sites for biomass facilities in terms of long-term sustainability. The main criteria established in this approach are outlined, evaluated, weighted and allocated to three criteria groups: environmental, geophysical and socio-economic groups. In the F-DEMATEL participatory method, constraints and their weight coefficients, with regard to their influence, are calculated. The most suitable locations are obtained after applying the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method. In the final stage of the decision-making problem, a sensitivity analysis of the criteria set is conducted, and the weights are determined for four implementation strategies. The model is applied in a case study of Extremadura where forest and agriculture are the typical land uses. The results of the F-DEMATEL/GIS-MCDA analysis suggest that the optimal sites for the locations of biomass plants are situated near forests and in zones with low transport costs, which comprise only 9.247% (Sh) of the total study area. Currently, five plants are installed in this area; however, they are not located in the most suitable areas (Sh). The most influential criteria of the model are the vegetation cover, agricultural area, transport cost and potential demand criteria. This methodology can be used in other studies to verify suitable locations for biomass plants in areas with similar geographical and spatial characteristics and available spatial data. Additionally, the proposed method of renewable energy policy planning can be applied to decision-making problems in the private sector and at various government levels.},

   abstract = {Smoking is the single biggest cause of preventable death in the Uited Kingdom (UK) and is a major cause of coronary heart disease, some cancers, and respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. At the time of initiating the project, smoking prevalence had not changed across four local government areas in South Yorkshire for some years. Most spending had been focussed on helping people quit, an intervention where there was clear evidence of effectiveness. A number of changes occurred in public health structures and targets, requiring a reappraisal of the range of interventions offered. This was challenging due to a lack of clear evidence for some of the areas’ alternative interventions. The aim of this paper is to describe the use of a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to support the health priority setting in local authorities to reduce smoking prevalence. There were three phases to this process: (1) problem structuring; (2) the multiple criteria decision analysis; (3) and using the MCDA results to influence decision making at the local government level. The MCDA approach was used to collate information in a consistent and transparent manner, using expert, stakeholder and public opinion to fill known gaps in evidence. Fifteen interventions (such as stop smoking support services, smoke-free spaces, communication and marketing exercises, and increased investment in enforcement) were ranked across eight criteria (relating to reductions in prevalence across relevant groups, as well as aspects relating to equity and feasibility), allowing a range of relevant concerns to be incorporated. Subsequent steps were taken to translate the results of this stage into workable policy options. The results differed significantly from current practice. Sensitivity analysis showed that the findings were robust to changes in preference weights. These results informed subsequent changes to the interventions offered across the four boroughs. The ability of MCDA techniques to incorporate data and both qualitative and quantitative judgements in a formal manner mean that they are well suited to support public health decision making, where evidence is often only partially available and many policies are value driven. MCDA methods, if used, should be chosen carefully based on their resource/time constraints, scientific validity, and the significance and broader context of the decision problem.},

   abstract = {Wastewater infrastructure management is increasingly important because of urbanization, environmental pollutants, aging infrastructures, and climate change. We propose a scenario-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework to compare different infrastructure alternatives in terms of their sustainability. These range from the current centralized system to semi- and fully decentralized options. Various sources of uncertainty are considered, including external socio-economic uncertainty captured by future scenarios, uncertainty in predicting outcomes of alternatives, and incomplete preferences of stakeholders. Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) with Monte Carlo simulation is performed, and rank acceptability indices help identify robust alternatives. We propose step-wise local sensitivity analysis, which is useful for practitioners to effectively elicit preferences and identify major sources of uncertainty. The approach is demonstrated in a Swiss case study where ten stakeholders are involved throughout. Their preferences are quantitatively elicited by combining an online questionnaire with face-to-face interviews. The trade-off questions reveal a high concern about environmental and an unexpectedly low importance of economic criteria. This results in a surprisingly good ranking of high-tech decentralized wastewater alternatives using urine source separation for most stakeholders in all scenarios. Combining scenario planning and MCDA proves useful, as the performance of wastewater infrastructure systems is indeed sensitive to socio-economic boundary conditions and the other sources of uncertainty. The proposed sensitivity analysis suggests that a simplified elicitation procedure is sufficient in many cases. Elicitation of more information such as detailed marginal value functions should only follow if the sensitivity analysis finds this necessary. Moreover, the uncertainty of rankings can be considerably reduced by better predictions of the outcomes of alternatives. Although the results are case based, the proposed decision framework is generalizable to other decision contexts.},

Decision analysis methods provide opportunities to explore alternatives for drinking water resources in impoverished, rural regions of developing countries.With varying success, southwestern Bangladesh communities currently use multiple drinking water sources, including rainwater harvesting, ponds, pond sand filters, managed aquifer recharge (MAR), and tubewells. This study uses a variety of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to assess the probable success of these drinking water sources based on various technical, economic, social, and environmental factors. Data include an assortment of physical and social sources including focus group interviews, surveys, and water quality measurements. Additionally, the MCDA methods (multiple attribute value theory, analytic hierarchy process, ELECTRE I, and ELECTRE III) are informed by preferences from three stakeholders-locals, nongovernmental organizations, and environmental science academics-to ensure proper weighting of criteria for success. Across all MCDA methods, we find that rainwater harvesting is the most likely to succeed as a reliable drinking water source in the region. Conversely, MAR is the least preferred alternative. Sensitivity analyses suggest a robust ranking order that is relatively insensitive to model parameters, including water source performance score and stakeholder weighting, across all criteria categories. This case study demonstrates how decision modeling and alternative assessment can be the first step to reach sustainable solutions in complex water management problems.},

   abstract = {Background: Identifying the optimal treatment in an acute postoperative setting remains a challenge. Multiple analgesic options are available, but comparing outcomes is limited by a lack of head-to-head trials. In addition, decisions based on efficacy only do not take drug safety into account. In such cases, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can be utilized to quantify and compare the efficacy and safety data of various drugs. Methodology: The efficacy-safety profiles of eight parenteral, postoperative analgesics (acetaminophen, diclofenac, ketorolac, metamizole, morphine, nefopam, parecoxib, trama-dol) widely used in Europe were evaluated using an MCDA model that included 17 criteria: three for efficacy and 14 for safety. Each drug was scored on each criterion on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), according to published data and the judgment of an expert panel. A weighting process was then applied to standardize the impact of each criterion and adjust drugs’ preference scores accordingly, normalizing them on the 0–100 scale. Sensitivity analyses were also performed, including a model in which analgesic profiles were compared when opioid sparing effect was set at a zero value for all drugs. Results: In the primary model, efficacy and safety had relative weightings of 64% and 36%, respectively. Efficacy and safety criteria with the highest values were pain relief (relative weight, 29%) and gastrointestinal effects (12%). Parecoxib received the highest overall score (93), followed by diclofenac (80), and ketorolac (75). Morphine scored the lowest (57), due to the lack of an opioid sparing effect. When opioid sparing was given a zero rating, parecoxib remained the highest scoring analgesic (93), followed by diclofenac (80), metamizole (76), and morphine (76). Parecoxib remained the most preferred analgesic in several other sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: This MCDA-based assessment suggests that parecoxib has the most favorable efficacy-safety profile among the assessed postoperative analgesics.},

   abstract = {The Navajo Nation (NN), a sovereign indigenous tribal nation in the Southwestern United States, is home to 523 abandoned uranium mines (AUMs). Previous health studies have articulated numerous human health hazards associated with AUMs and multiple environmental mechanisms/pathways (e.g., air, water, and soil) for contaminant transport. Despite this evidence, the limited modeling of AUM contamination that exists relies solely on proximity to mines and only considers single rather than combined pathways from which the contamination is a product. In order to better understand the spatial dynamics of contaminant exposure across the NN, we adopted the following established geospatial and computational methods to develop a more sophisticated environmental risk map illustrating the potential for AUM contamination: GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA), fuzzy logic, and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Eight criteria layers were selected for the GIS-MCDA model: proximity to AUMs, roadway proximity, drainage proximity, topographic landforms, wind index, topographic wind exposure, vegetation index, and groundwater contamination. Model sensitivity was evaluated using the one-at-a-time method, and statistical validation analysis was conducted using two separate environmental datasets. The sensitivity analysis indicated consistency and reliability of the model. Model results were strongly associated with environmental uranium concentrations. The model classifies 20.2% of the NN as high potential for AUM contamination while 65.7% and 14.1% of the region are at medium and low risk, respectively. This study is entirely a novel application and a crucial first step toward informing future epidemiologic studies and ongoing remediation efforts to reduce human exposure to AUM waste.},

Benefits derived from increased tourism for the municipality and cruise ships are often at odds with the environmental and social impacts associated with continued historical port use. This study illustrates the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for weighing of various criteria and metrics related to the environment, economy, and social sustainability for the selection of a sustainable cruise line route. Specifically, MCDA methodology was employed in Venice, Italy to illustrate its application. First, the four most representative navigational route projects among those presented to local authorities were assessed based on social, economic, and environmental considerations. Second, a pool of experts representing the local authority, private port businesses, and cruise line industry were consulted to evaluate the validity and weight assignments for the selected criteria. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was employed to assess the robustness of the recommendations using an evaluation of weight changes and their effects on the ranking of alternative navigational routes. The results were presented and discussed in a multi-stakeholder meeting to further the route selection process.},

   abstract = {Background: The aim of the current study is to perform a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) of the proactive, person-centred integrated primary care programme U-PROFIT for frail elderly in the Netherlands. Although, the cost-effectiveness of U-PROFIT has been assessed in a large trial, this MCDA includes a more comprehensive set of outcomes that are summarized in a single value to inform decision making from multiple perspectives. A unique feature of U-PROFIT is the twosteps frailty screening combining information from the Electronic Medical Record and self-reported data. The frail elderly receive a holistic assessment from a registered nurse that is translated into an individualised care plan. The nurse provides integrated care in collaboration with the GP and other relevant disciplines. Methods: The population consisted of frail elderly aged ≥ 69 years from three general practices in the Utrecht region. This study was a 12-month prospective cohort study applying a regressiondiscontinuity design. The cut-off score to define an intervention and control group was an age of 75; frail patients aged ≥ 75 years from the three GP practices received the U-PROFIT intervention, and frail patients aged 69-74 years were assigned to the control group based on the two-steps frailty screening. In both age groups elderly had to meet the same frailty criteria. Data on the performance of U-PROFIT was collected by questionnaires and is ongoing until September 2018. Outcomes included physical functioning, psychological well-being, social participation and relationships, enjoyment of life, person-centeredness and continuity of care. Inverse probability weighting was applied and linear regression analyses were performed including the treatment variable, age, baseline outcome and the interaction between treatment and age. The weights for the MCDA were obtained by a discrete choice experiment among patients, partners (informal caregivers), professional care providers, payers and policy makers (n~150 in each stakeholder group). The performance was multiplied by the weights to obtain the overall value score for UPROFIT and usual care. Results: In the MCDA-analysis, the overall value for integrated care was higher than for usual care due to higher partial value scores of psychological well-being, enjoyment of life, personcenteredness and continuity of care. Results were consistent across stakeholder groups and also deterministic sensitivity analysis with Swing Weights showed similar results. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that in approximately 95% of the repetitions, the overall value score was higher for integrated care compared to usual care. Discussion: Preliminary results showed that U-PROFIT seems to add value when multiple criteria are considered in an MCDA including health and well-being outcomes and experience with care and explicating the perspectives of patients, partners, professionals, payers and policy makers. This study had an innovative methodological approach by combining a regression discontinuity design with MCDA. A limitation of this study was that the significant differences between the intervention and control group at baseline that were not entirely eliminated by inverse probability weighting. Policy implications are that in order to obtain high overall value, integrated care programmes should aim at improving health and well-being outcomes for people with multimorbidity such as frail elderly.

   abstract = {Background: Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)) has a relatively low harm and low dependence liability but is scheduled on List I of the Dutch Opium Act (‘hard drugs’). Concerns surrounding increasing MDMA-related criminality coupled with the possibly inappropriate scheduling of MDMA initiated a debate to revise the current Dutch ecstasy policy. Methods: An interdisciplinary group of 18 experts on health, social harms and drug criminality and law enforcement reformulated the science-based Dutch MDMA policy using multi-decision multi-criterion decision analysis (MD-MCDA). The experts collectively formulated policy instruments and rated their effects on 25 outcome criteria, including health, criminality, law enforcement and financial issues, thematically grouped in six clusters. Results: The experts scored the effect of 22 policy instruments, each with between two and seven different mutually exclusive options, on 25 outcome criteria. The optimal policy model was defined by the set of 22 policy instrument options which gave the highest overall score on the 25 outcome criteria. Implementation of the optimal policy model, including regulated MDMA sales, decreases health harms, MDMA-related organised crime and environmental damage, as well as increases state revenues and quality of MDMA products and user information. This model was slightly modified to increase its political feasibility. Sensitivity analyses showed that the outcomes of the current MD-MCDA are robust and independent of variability in weight values. Conclusion: The present results provide a feasible and realistic set of policy instrument options to revise the legislation towards a rational MDMA policy that is likely to reduce both adverse (public) health risks and MDMA-related criminal burden.},

   abstract = {This chapter presents various approaches to incorporating formal modelling of risks and uncertainties into multi-criteria decision analysis, in a theoretically valid but also operationally meaningful manner. We consider both internal uncertainties (in the formulation and modelling of the decision problem), and external uncertainties arising from exogenous factors, but with greater attention paid to the latter. After a broad discussion on the meaning of uncertainty, we first review approaches to sensitivity analysis, which is particularly, although not exclusively, relevant to internal uncertainties. We discuss the role, but also some limitations, of representing uncertainties in formal probabilistic structures, linked also to concepts of expected (multi-attribute) utility theory. Such probability/utility approaches may be used in explicitly identifying a most preferred solution, or simply to eliminate certain courses of action when stochastically dominated (in various senses) by others. In some contexts it may be useful to view minimization of various risk measures as additional criteria in more standard MCDA models, and we comment on advantages and disadvantages of such approaches. Finally we discuss the integration of MCDA with scenario planning, in order to deal with deeper uncertainties (not easily if at all representable by probability models), particularly in a strategic planning context. The emphasis throughout is on the practice of MCDA rather than on esoteric theoretical results.},

   abstract = {There is often a complicated process for planning and constructing rural housings under the influence of (mass)-tourism in reservoir areas, involving multiple evaluation criteria use and geographical information analysis. With some methodologies within a unique framework considering current increasing construction sprawls and ecological consequences, these approaches will overcome existing shortcomings, especially spatial decision and visual impact problems on sustainable rural housing planning and construction. This paper presents a distinct web-based graphic model of sustainable rural housing planning and construction with a Fuzzy-DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory/Multi-Criteria-Spatial Decision Support System (F-DEMATEL/MC-SDSS) method in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment applied to Alange, Spain as a case study. The aim of this methodology is to optimally eco-design rural housings under (mass)-tourism in reservoir areas, as for their sensitivity and effect. The methodology presents herein the combined method of GIS and Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) together with F-DEMATEL method. Because of the technological improvements in the area of information systems, it has a great necessity to study in what way to combine GIS, MCDA, Weighted Linear Combination (WLC), sensitivity analysis, the Internet, modeling, and database, targeting to generate MC-SDSS based on a web-based platform. A methodological framework named as web-based F-DEMATEL/MC-SDSS is suggested by means of a totally united GIS and definite MCDA model by programed in ArcGIS software's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and Model View Controller (MVC) to be an object-oriented system. These program languages interact on an algorithmic web server that processing the MCDA products. The model consists of four main modules: the general overview module, the F-DEMATEL/MC-SDSS module, the sensitivity analysis module, and, finally, the final result module especially with the buildings suitability option, which users can access consecutively. Through the web graphic model developed, seven rural housings constructed in the area can be checked their suitability based on the selected criteria of decision-makers. Therefore, the results can be used to verify sustainable housings’ sites and designs differentiated parts of space as the asynchronous process of decision-makings. Thus, this model can be a channel to collaborate and communicate the spatial design and visual impact strategies of sustainable housings for decision-makers, who have practical and specific purposes.},

Objectives To use a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare the oral anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and vitamin K antagonist (VKAs; specifically warfarin) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Methods We identified the evaluation criteria through a targeted literature review and clinical judgment. The final evaluation model included nine clinical events and four other criteria. We ranked possibly fatal clinical event criteria on the basis of the differences in risks of fatal events and the corresponding window of therapeutic opportunity, as observed in clinical trials. Clinical judgment was used to rank other criteria. Full criteria ranking was used to calculate centroid weights, which were combined with individual treatment performances to estimate the overall value score for each treatment. Results Using such an MCDA, dabigatran yielded the highest overall value, approximately 6% higher than that of the second-best treatment, apixaban. Dabigatran also had the highest first-rank probability (0.72) in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Rivaroxaban performed worse than the other non-VKA oral anticoagulants, but better than VKAs (with both having 0.00 first-rank probability). The results were insensitive to changes in model structure. Conclusions When all key oral anticoagulant value criteria and their relative importance are investigated in an MCDA, dabigatran appears to rank the highest and warfarin the lowest.},

Here we propose a process to fill this gap. Research method: Rich Picture and VFT structure the problem and elicit objectives that become criteria within a decision hierarchy. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with ratings supports preference elicitation and sensitivity analysis in the judgment weights of decision-makers. Main findings: VFT is effective for eliciting the decision structure to AHP; using weight distribution of stakeholders may affect the results, and the multimethodology approach developed here can deal with group decision making. Implications for theory and practice: The approach developed is effective in complex environments (complex problems and multiple stakeholders) because it focuses on values and defines a process to bring those values into a multicriteria method. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis with the judgment weights of the different stakeholders may be useful in negotiation.},

   abstract = {Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is increasingly used to support healthcare decision-making. MCDA involves decision makers evaluating the alternatives under consideration based on the explicit weighting of criteria relevant to the overarching decision—in order to, depending on the application, rank (or prioritize) or choose between the alternatives. A prominent example of MCDA applied to healthcare decision-making that has received a lot of attention in recent years and is the main subject of this article is choosing which health “technologies” (i.e., drugs, devices, procedures, etc.) to fund—a process known as health technology assessment (HTA). Other applications include prioritizing patients for surgery, prioritizing diseases for R&D, and decision-making about licensing treatments. Most applications are based on weighted-sum models. Such models involve explicitly weighting the criteria and rating the alternatives on the criteria, with each alternative’s “performance” on the criteria aggregated using a linear (i.e., additive) equation to produce the alternative’s “total score,” by which the alternatives are ranked. The steps involved in a MCDA process are explained, including an overview of methods for scoring alternatives on the criteria and weighting the criteria. The steps are: structuring the decision problem being addressed, specifying criteria, measuring alternatives’ performance, scoring alternatives on the criteria and weighting the criteria, applying the scores and weights to rank the alternatives, and presenting the MCDA results, including sensitivity analysis, to decision makers to support their decision-making. Arguments recently advanced against using MCDA for HTA and counterarguments are also considered. Finally, five questions associated with how MCDA for HTA is operationalized are discussed: Whose preferences are relevant for MCDA? Should criteria and weights be decision-specific or identical for repeated applications? How should cost or cost-effectiveness be included in MCDA? How can the opportunity cost of decisions be captured in MCDA? How can uncertainty be incorporated into MCDA?},

Besides using geographic information systems (GIS) spatial representation of potential reservoir areas, for the MCDA method, several spatial criteria, environmental and social constraints, and positive incentives (e.g., the proximity to existing power generation facilities of renewable energy sources) were contemplated. As a result, sixty-two alternatives or potential reservoir sites were identified, and thirteen criteria (seven constraints and six incentives) were considered. The final stage of this study consisted of conducting a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of the solutions obtained and giving insights regarding each criterion’s influence on the reservoir sites selected.

   abstract = {Sustainable development in education is growing a public awareness and is gaining an increasing importance to improve a long-term learning program. However, a higher sustainability education is an initial phase as ever in many universities. E-learning systems in science education based on innovative information and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have close relationship in effective long-standing learnings of sustainability and numerous criteria. Also, the technological challenge integrated to sustainability science education has been focused on e-learning programs, which can fill current educational niche. This paper presents a combined application, Fuzzy-DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory/Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (F-DEMATEL/MCDA) technique, identifying and analyzing e-learning systems' the most essential criteria for sustainability science education. The main criteria to accomplish this goal proposed are delineated, weighted, appraised and assigned into four groups such as sustainability, science education, e-learning and technology criteria. Sixteen sub-criteria were analyzed by the participatory F-DEMATEL technique on the basis of coefficients' value and computation in the context of impact and examination. For the final decision problem, the most important criteria are acquired with the help of Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) assessed by six implementation strategies’ sensitivity analysis (A to F) and the sub-criteria by a professional online survey. Analysis on F-DEMATEL/MCDA shows sustainability criteria (Strategy A, 0.54 with 84% most likely and likely professional perception survey) that is the most essential criteria in sustainability and e-learning systems science education. Also, it indicates information environmental (0.57 with 77% most likely and likely professional perception survey) is the most essential variable among sub-criteria. Strategy F considering the most important criteria as equal (0.25) got 19% positively perception professional assessment. Consequently, fuzzy-operational and multi-decision analysis and professional survey could be utilized to find out the most essential sustainability science e-learning criteria that also could be engaged to make pliable and pertinent decision features.},

In this study, the base and binder layers of road asphalt pavements were prepared by using reclaimed asphalt pavement and construction and demolition waste as coarse aggregates, while jet grouting waste and fly ash served as fillers. A leaching test was performed for the marginal materials, after which the engineering performances of the designed asphalt mixtures were investigated through laboratory tests. A life cycle assessment methodology was applied to determine the life cycle impacts of one cubic meter of each asphalt solution. Next, a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed for the solutions suggested for the binder and base layers. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the most suitable MCDA solutions by varying the weights for a total of 24 different weight configurations. The results of this work revealed that the solutions utilizing jet grouting waste (in particular, the hot asphalt mixture for the binder layer and cold asphalt mixture for the base layer) were preferred to other traditional and alternative solutions in most decision-making scenarios.},

   abstract = {GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is increasingly used to support flood risk assessment. However, conventional GIS-MCDA methods fail to adequately represent spatial variability and are accompanied with considerable uncertainty. It is, thus, important to incorporate spatial variability and uncertainty into GIS-based decision analysis procedures. This research develops a spatially explicit, probabilistic GIS-MCDA approach for the delineation of potentially flood susceptible areas. The approach integrates the probabilistic and the local ordered weighted averaging (OWA) methods via Monte Carlo simulation, to take into account the uncertainty related to criteria weights, spatial heterogeneity of preferences and the risk attitude of the analyst. The approach is applied to a pilot study for the Gucheng County, central China, heavily affected by the hazardous 2012 flood. A GIS database of six geomorphological and hydrometeorological factors for the evaluation of susceptibility was created. Moreover, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were performed to investigate the robustness of the model. The results indicate that the ensemble method improves the robustness of the model outcomes with respect to variation in criteria weights and identifies which criteria weights are most responsible for the variability of model outcomes. Therefore, the proposed approach is an improvement over the conventional deterministic method and can provides a more rational, objective and unbiased tool for flood susceptibility evaluation.},

   abstract = {Background: Despite a growing global commitment to universal health coverage, considerable vaccine coverage and uptake gaps persist in resource-constrained settings. One way of addressing the gaps is by ensuring product innovation is relevant and responsive to the needs of these contexts. Total Systems Effectiveness (TSE) framework has been developed to characterize preferred vaccine attributes from the perspective of country decision-makers to inform research and development (R&D) of products. A proof of concept pilot study took place in Thailand in 2018 to examine the feasibility and usefulness of the TSE approach using a rotavirus hypothetical test-case. Methods: The excel-based model used multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare and evaluate five hypothetical rotavirus vaccine products. The model was populated with local data and products were ranked against decision criteria identified by Thai stakeholders. A one-way sensitivity analysis was performed to identify criteria that influenced vaccine ranking. Self-assessment forms were distributed to R&D stakeholders on the usability of the approach and were subsequently analysed. Results: The model identified significant parameters that impacted on MCDA rankings. Self-assessment forms revealed that TSE was perceived as being able to encourage closer collaboration between country decision makers and vaccine developers. Conclusions: The pilot study demonstrates that it is feasible to use an MCDA approach to elicit stakeholder preferences and determine influential parameters to help identify the preferred product characteristics for R&D from the perspective of country decision-makers. It found that TSE can help steer manufacturers to develop products that are better aligned with country need. Findings will guide further development of the TSE concept.},

   abstract = {A common feature of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to evaluate sustainable manufacturing is the participation (to various extents) of Decision Makers (DMs) or experts (e.g. to define the importance, or “weight”, of each criterion). This is an undesirable requirement that can be time consuming and complex, but it can also lead to disagreement between multiple DMs. Another drawback of typical MCDA methods is the limited scope of weight sensitivity analyses that are usually performed for one criterion at the time or on an arbitrary basis, struggling to show the “big picture” of the decision making space that can be complex in many real-world cases. This work removes all the mentioned shortcomings implementing automatic weighting through an ordinal combinatorial ranking of criteria objectively set by four pre-defined weight distributions. Such solution provides the DM not only with a fast, rational and systematic method, but also with a broader and more accurate insight into the decision making space considered. Additionally, the entropy of information in the criteria can be used to adjust the weights and emphasise the differences between potentially close alternatives. The proposed methodology is derived generalising a problem of material selection of automotive parts in metal casting manufacturing systems. In particular, three typical aluminium, magnesium and zinc alloys in a High-Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) process are compared using the deterministic Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) combining 18 criteria organised in 4 main categories (cost, quality, time and environmental sustainability). A detailed and systematic approach to calculate the considered criteria is also provided and it includes Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) considerations. Results show that, although in most of the cases the aluminium alloy is the best option, there are a few areas in the decision making space where magnesium and zinc alloys score better without a simple correlation to categories. This shows how valuable the proposed mapping process is to understand the complex MCDA analyses. The methodology does not make specific assumptions about metal casting and can be applied to sustainable manufacturing in general.},

   abstract = {Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods have shown advantages in supporting decision-making with problems that confront conflicting objectives. However, current applications to complex environmental problems featuring the dynamic social sphere, particularly problems involving cultural heritage and nature, have yet to substantially reflect this. The dynamic social sphere reflects the demand for scenario forecasting in decision-making support. This knowledge gap has not been addressed sufficiently in MCDA research. A participatory MCDA method is hence proposed as a merger with Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) as the scenario forecasting. The MCDA is then carried out to tackle a complex environmental problem caused by traditional food production in a historic town, Daxi in Taiwan. The result reveals a remarkable willingness to support this issue of a historically significant industry causing detriment to environment (with WTP estimate of 128,700,000 USD from the public) and suggests a plan that applies multiple policy instruments rather than following a potentially adverse polluter-pays principle. This manifests the authors' argument that recognition of heritage significance has dramatically affected selection of policy instruments and provides a critical recommendation to the local government which has struggled to find solutions. The proposed MCDA also highlights its participatory aspect for addressing issues involving cultural heritage, supported by several key steps, in particular the intervention-impact value tree building, the scenario forecasting and the sensitivity analysis.},

In Bhutan, dengue incidence has been on the rise since 2004, with numerous outbreaks reported across the country. The aim of this study was to identify and map areas that are vulnerable to dengue in Bhutan. Methodology/Principal findings We conducted a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) using a weighted linear combination (WLC) to obtain a vulnerability map of dengue. Risk factors (criteria) were identified and assigned with membership values for vulnerability according to the available literature. Sensitivity analysis and validation of the model was conducted to improve the robustness and predictive ability of the map. Our study revealed marked differences in geographical vulnerability to dengue by location and season. Low-lying areas and those located along the southern border were consistently found to be at higher risk of dengue. The vulnerability extended to higher elevation areas including some areas in the Capital city Thimphu during the summer season. The higher risk was mostly associated with relatively high population density, agricultural and built-up landscapes and relatively good road connectivity. Conclusions Using MCDA, our study identified vulnerable areas in Bhutan during specific seasons when and where the transmission of dengue is most likely to occur. This study provides evidence for the National Vector-borne Disease Control programme to optimize the use of limited public health resources for surveillance and vector control, to mitigate the public health threat of dengue.},

To compare the sustainability assessment results, a selection of 8 criteria describing 12 DH companies (DHC) was examined. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most credible MCDA method. Criteria weights were changed: (1) individually for evaluation of the range of stability for alternatives (score of DHC performance); (2) individually by a fixed value to compare how each criterion weight change affected the average score of a result; and (3) to compare the AHP weighting method to an equal weight scenario. The results of sensitivity analysis along with literature investigation shows that all methods are suitable for sustainability analyses of DH systems while also having differences in the calculation process and in the interpretation of results. The generalized algorithm for sustainability analysis in the energy sector outlined in this study along with the documented features of the main MCDA methods can be used as a guide for future assessment of energy systems by researchers and industry professionals.},

The MCDA is usually performed employing a deterministic approach. Such an approach is rather not adequate to include model uncertainties connected with both: decision maker preferences (criteria weights) and process input data. By considering the stochastic nature of uncertainties, it is possible to generate results that can easily be analyzed statistically. In addition, such an approach allows investigating the consequences of the resulting uncertainty of multi-attribute aggregation on the final decision. In this study, we define, analyze and compare four different technologies of biodiesel production from used cooking oil (UCO) using probabilistic MCDA. Among the criteria, we consider energy, economic, environmental, as well as social aspects. To evaluate the uncertainty of the final results, we propose a novel method, coupling Monte Carlo simulation and method of data reconciliation. Firstly, we present the results of the deterministic case, in which we assume the exact values of criteria and the preferences. Besides, we investigate on a sensitivity of the results to identify the major factors affecting the economic, energy, environmental and social viability of biodiesel production. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis of the contributions of the different phases of the UCO processing to the resulting criteria. Finally, we introduce inaccurate or uncertain criteria values and criteria preferences to evaluate the uncertainty of the results.},

   abstract = {Background: To provide value-based care for patients with multi-morbidity, innovative integrated care programmes and comprehensive evaluations of such programmes are required. In Norway, a new programme called “Holistic Continuity of Patient Care” (HCPC) addresses the issue of multi-morbidity by providing integrated care within learning networks for frail elderly patients who receive municipal home care services or a short-term stay in a nursing home. This study conducts a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate whether the HCPC programme performs better on a large set of outcomes corresponding to the ‘triple aim’ compared to usual care. Methods: Prospective longitudinal survey data were collected at baseline and follow-up after 6-months. The assessment of HCPC was implemented by a novel MCDA framework. The relative weights of importance of the outcomes used in the MCDA were obtained from a discrete choice experiment among five different groups of stakeholders. The performance score was estimated using a quasi-experimental design and linear mixed methods. Performance scores were standardized and multiplied by their weights of importance to obtain the overall MCDA value by stakeholder group. Results: At baseline in the HCPC and usual care groups, respectively, 120 and 89 patients responded, of whom 87 and 41 responded at follow-up. The average age at baseline was 80.0 years for HCPC and 83.6 for usual care. Matching reduced the standardized differences between the groups for patient background characteristics and outcome variables. The MCDA results indicated that HCPC was preferred to usual care irrespective of stakeholders. The better performance of HCPC was mostly driven by improvements in enjoyment of life, psychological well-being, and social relationships and participation. Results were consistent with sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation. Conclusion: Frail elderly with multi-morbidity represent complex health problems at large costs for society in terms of health- and social care. This study is a novel contribution to assessing and understanding HCPC programme performance respecting the multi-dimensionality of desired outcomes. Integrated care programmes like HCPC may improve well-being of patients, be cost-saving, and contribute to the pursuit of evidence based gradual reforms in the care of frail elderly.},

Here, we outline a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach that can be used to rapidly identify potentially dangerous lakes in regions without existing tailored GLOF risk assessments, where a range of glacial lake types exist, and where field data are sparse or non-existent. Our MCDA model (1) is desk-based and uses freely and widely available data inputs and software, and (2) allows the relative risk posed by a range of glacial lake types to be assessed simultaneously within any region. A review of the factors that influence GLOF risk, combined with the strict rules of criteria selection inherent to MCDA, has allowed us to identify 13 exhaustive, non-redundant, and consistent risk criteria. We use our MCDA model to assess the risk of 16 extant glacial lakes and 6 lakes that have already generated GLOFs, and found that our results agree well with previous studies. For the first time in GLOF risk assessment, we employed sensitivity analyses to test the strength of our model results and assumptions, and to identify lakes that are sensitive to the criteria and risk thresholds used. A key benefit of the MCDA method is that sensitivity analyses are readily undertaken. Overall, these sensitivity analyses lend support to our model, although we suggest that further work is required to determine the relative importance of assessment criteria, and the thresholds that determine the level of risk for each criterion. As a case study, the tested method was then applied to 25 potentially dangerous lakes in the Bolivian Andes, where GLOF risk is poorly understood; 3 lakes are found to pose ‘medium’ or ‘high’ risk, and require further detailed investigation.},

The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques are most recently used to map soil erosion hotspots in Ethiopia. Aligned to that, this study aims to identify and compare the risk of soil erosion using the RUSLE and MCDA approach in Sodo watershed covering 80.54 km2, central Ethiopia. The adjusted parameters of RUSLE and MCDA demanding soil, land use, and terrain feature data were used for the study. Finally, cross-comparison was effected to check their consistency. The RUSLE model shows 68.91% of the study area accounted for a soil loss of < 10 ton/ha/year, whereas 6.47% for the watershed loss of > 75 ton/ha/year. Generally, the mean annual gross soil loss amounts to 783,170 tons, with the mean soil loss rate of 35.28 tons/ha/year. This is 1.96 times higher than the tolerable limit for Ethiopian highlands. The MCDA result shows that 5.6%, 50.57%, and 43.83% of the watershed are highly, moderately, and slightly sensitive to soil erosion, respectively. The overlay result reveals that 49.4% of the risk and location of land susceptibility was similarly estimated by RUSLE and MCDA. This is a “good agreement” with a Kappa value of 0.62. The consistency increases with a decreasing level of sensitivity. Therefore, this could be an input for local decision-makers and experts at large.},

Nevertheless, due to the inherent uncertainty of input data and subjectivity involved in the selection of influential parameters, the identification of RWH potential areas is a challenging procedure. In this study, two approaches for locating potential RWH sites were implemented. In the first approach, a frequently-used method of the multi-criteria decision analysis and geographic information system (MCDA-GIS) was utilized, while, in the second approach, a novel strategy of integrating the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model as a hydrology model into an MCDA-GIS method was proposed to evaluate its performance in locating potential RWH sites. The Mashhad Plain Basin (MPB) was selected as a case study area. The developed potential RWH maps of the two approaches indicated similar patterns for potential RWH areas; in addition, the correlation coefficient (CC) between the two obtained maps were relatively high (i.e., CC = 0.914) revealing that integration of SWAT as a comprehensive hydrologic model does not necessarily result in very different outputs from the conventional method of MCDA-GIS for RWH evaluation. The overlap of developed maps of the two approaches indicated that 3394 km2 of the study area, mainly located in the northern parts, was identified as high-potential RWH areas. The performed sensitivity analysis indicated that rainfall and slope criteria, with weights of 0.329 and 0.243, respectively, had the greatest sensitivity on the model in the first approach while in the second approach, the criterion of runoff coefficient (with weights of 0.358) had the highest impact. Based on results from the identification of the potential locations for conventional RWH techniques, pond and pan techniques are the most proper options, covering high-potential areas of RWH more effectively than other techniques over MPB.},

Study focus: Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) site suitability has been widely studied through multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). However, the selection of areas for MAR project implementation can be a vague process with different validation approaches. The aim of this study was to create a site suitability map for MAR projects and conduct a sensitivity analysis for the selection of an area of interest (AOI) by combining highly suitable and low sensitive areas. Ten hydrologic and hydrogeologic criteria were chosen for the selection of sites for the MAR project. All criteria were reclassified and used in a MCDA that combined Analytic Hierarchy Processes (AHP) and pairwise comparisons to construct a site suitability map. Validation of the map and the AOI selected was performed using hydrograph data. Based on the AOI map, water availability and frequency were analysed using gauging station data. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: The selected AOI represents high spatio-temporal variability in natural recharge rates, highly dependent on the Namoi River streamflow. Moreover, all recharge rates in the AOI are high, particularly in the paleochannel surrounding the current Namoi River. The selected AOI coincides with an area of thick coarse sediments underlying the riverbed and demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed methodology.},

   abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is an important component of environmental modelling and in recent years, variance-based, global sensitivity analysis techniques, such as Sobol', have been a preferred approach for achieving this. However, these techniques are generally only applicable to simulation models and not to models used to rank alternative options, such as multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods. In order to overcome this limitation, a modified Sobol' method for MCDA (Sobol'-MCDA) is introduced in this paper. The method has the following features: (i) it enables the stability or robustness of the relative ranking of two alternatives to be assessed in the light of changes in assessment criteria and stakeholder preferences; and (ii) it enables the sensitivity of the ranking of two alternatives to changes in assessment criteria and stakeholder preferences to be assessed. The approach is demonstrated for a water resources case study from the literature consisting of seven alternatives and ten assessment criteria.},

To deal with decision-making priorities for environmental issues where uncertainties and inconsistencies are inherent in input data sources a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach using an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine weights and fuzzy numbers to account for input data uncertainties is developed and is illustrated for determination of critical metal recovery priorities from Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in Europe. A spreadsheet programme with many user-friendly input and output features is developed to aid data-handling and the calculations required in the MCDA approach. Where data uncertainties exist, weighted input parameters for the critical metals are determined by an absolute judgement panel of key stakeholders and include data on: recovery potential, geographical supply concentration and stability, end use substitution, future metal demand and economic importance in key industrial sectors. Sensitivity analyses can be carried out on results of recovery priority outputs by simple numerical variation of input parameters and/or by the use of specialist input decision panels representing stakeholder groups with differing priorities, and the results suggest that recovery priorities in the European situation should concentrate on gallium, indium and germanium. The spreadsheet-MCDA program set up in developing the methodology for criticality has wide general application in environmental decision-making analysis particularly where uncertainties exist in the input data required.},

Due to the great mechanical properties of fiber reinforced plastics, it is a desirable material for various applications, but at the same time its heterogenic structure makes the composite waste hard to recycle. This paper focuses on different fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) waste recycling methods and their comparison by carrying out literature review and using multi-criteria decision making analysis (MCDA). Four polymer matrix composite waste recycling methods are compared to calculate which one has the best sustainability performance based on the chosen criteria. Analytical Hierarchy Process and TOPSIS are applied for criteria weighing and method comparison. Sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the obtained results. It is concluded that more studies concerning different FRP waste recycling method sustainability performance need to be done, to derive more data, that would make MCDA more reliable and also other FRP waste recycling methods could be compared. Another conclusion is that different methods have different strengths which makes it hard to compare them. While FRP waste recycling is getting more broadly used, there still is a lot of work to establish wide spread effective system of FRP waste recycling that is both economically viable and gives the best results concerning recycled material quality.},

We used an ANP approach in combination with the concepts of global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses, in order to minimize any associated errors. This approach was tested for a LSSM application in north-western Iran, using a methodology that consisted of three distinct phases. An ANP approach was used in the first phase to derive criteria weightings by analysing relevant criteria, which included topographic, hydrologic, climatologic, geological, and anthropological indicators. The second phase involved evaluating the uncertainty and sensitivity of areas susceptible to subsidence as a function of the derived weightings, using Monte Carlo simulations. The third phase then used a land subsidence inventory database to validate the results and to measure any improvement in accuracy following sensitivity analysis. Results indicated a 6% improvement in the accuracy of the ANP method as a result of using an integrated global sensitivity analysis.},

Here, a planning framework for Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) that evolved during a two-year study evaluating alternative strategies for dual water supply within a local government context is described. The planning framework was developed to overcome the obstacles that surfaced over the course of the study. It provides a structured approach to strategic decision making that integrates triple bottom line (TBL), multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, and participatory decision making into an exploration of water supply alternatives. TBL assured stakeholders that the decisions considered the financial, social, and environmental performance. MCDA provided visibility into the benefits and trade-offs of the alternatives by providing a quantitative method for comparing alternatives that incorporates incommensurate performance indicators and priorities of multiple stakeholders. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses addressed concerns regarding decision risk and improved transparency into inputs driving uncertainty in the analysis. Finally, a flexible participatory process helped to circumvent socio-institutional barriers by adapting the methodology and increasing cooperation among stakeholders and multidisciplinary experts. The resulting collaborative, risk-informed, TBL-MCDA (CRTM) planning framework helps to refine the feasible set of alternatives by providing more transparency into the drivers, technologies, and stakeholders influencing the decision. The planning framework increased the number of participants that were involved in the study, increased interaction between participants, changed the structure of the decision problem, increased the number of performance indicators considered, and improved stakeholder cooperation in the decision process.},

   abstract = {Background: The objective of this study was to assess the potential impact of the implementation of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) on the Polish pricing and reimbursement (P&R) process with regard to orphan drugs. Methods: A four step approach was designed. Firstly, a systematic literature review was conducted to select the MCDA criteria. Secondly, a database of orphan drugs was established. Thirdly, health technology appraisals (HTA recommendations) were categorized and an MCDA appraisal was conducted. Finally, a comparison of HTA and MCDA outcomes was carried out. An MCDA outcome was considered positive if more than 50 % of the maximum number of points was reached (base case). In the sensitivity analysis, 25 % and 75 % thresholds were tested as well. Results: Out of 2242 publications, 23 full-text articles were included. The final MCDA tool consisted of ten criteria. In total, 27 distinctive drug-indication pairs regarding 21 drugs were used for the study. Six negative and 21 positive HTA recommendations were issued. In the base case, there were 19 positive MCDA outcomes. Of the 27 cases, there were 12 disagreements between the HTA and MCDA outcomes, the majority of which related to positive HTA guidance for negative MCDA outcomes. All drug-indication pairs with negative HTA recommendations were appraised positively in the MCDA framework. Economic details were available for 12 cases, of which there were 9 positive MCDA outcomes. Amongst the 12 drug-indication pairs, two were negatively appraised in the HTA process, with positive MCDA guidance, and two were appraised in the opposite direction. Conclusions: An MCDA approach may lead to different P&R outcomes compared to a standard HTA process. On the one hand, enrichment of the list of decision making criteria means further scrutiny of a given health technology and as such increases the odds of a negative P&R outcome. On the other hand, it may uncover additional values and as such increase the odds of positive P&R outcomes.},

The results show that the most suitable sites are in the north and northwest of the Riyadh region, with an area that represents 16,748 Km2 with an 80% suitability degree. In addition, it was proven that Afif is the largest suitable city. It has high solar radiation, at an average of 2.631687 MWh/m2/year, and low temperatures, at an average of 26.3 °C, as well as having flat areas with a slope under 5°.

Traditional parks, gardens and street trees now sit alongside innovative approaches including rooftop pollinator habitats, constructed wetlands and hydroponic green facades, each of which has its own particular challenges and benefits. This variety of solutions introduces an important new decision-making challenge for cities wishing to implement NBS: choosing the right set of specific NBS interventions. Decision support tools such as Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can help navigate complex decisions, but their application to urban NBS selection decisions has been limited. Current NBS assessment frameworks tend to either give highly aggregated results, or are tailored to only one specific ecosystem service. Here we demonstrate a novel application of MCDA to the practical challenge of selecting a set of NBS to address multiple urban challenges. The MCDA tool developed here was used in seven cities participating in the European Union project ‘Urban GreenUP’. We describe the development and use of the MCDA tool, and explore how cities used the tool to guide NBS selection. We also evaluate the tool using sensitivity analysis and feedback from users. We find that participating cities are seeking to balance a large number of possible benefits from NBS solutions, and the tool proved useful for navigating the selection decision. Users identified opportunities to improve the tool's usability and clarity. They also noted a key strength of the tool as a prompt for co-production of knowledge and decisions. Collectively, these findings advance the design and application of tools to support complex decisions about selecting NBS to address diverse urban challenges.},

Regarding the local decision context of these models, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) may be of added value to cost-utility analysis (CUA), because it covers a wider range of outcomes. This study compares the 2 methods using a side-by-side application. Methods: A new Dutch model of care, Primary Care Plus (PC+), was used as a case study to compare the results of CUA and MCDA. Data of patients referred to PC+ or care-as-usual were retrieved by questionnaires and administrative databases with a 3-month follow-up. Propensity score matching together with generalized linear regression models was used to reduce confounding. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore uncertainty in the results. Results: Although both methods indicated PC+ as the dominant alternative, complementary differences were observed. MCDA provided additional evidence that PC+ improved access to care (standardized performance score of 0.742 vs 0.670) and that improvement in health-related quality of life was driven by the psychological well-being component (standardized performance score of 0.710 vs 0.704). Furthermore, MCDA estimated the budget required for PC+ to be affordable in addition to preferable (€521.42 per patient). Additionally, MCDA was less sensitive to the utility measures used. Conclusions: MCDA may facilitate an auditable and transparent evaluation of new models of care by providing additional information on a wider range of outcomes and incorporating affordability. However, more effort is needed to increase the usability of MCDA among local decision makers.},

Several combinations of MCDA methods and weighting approaches were compared to assess how much results can differ. Eight indicators were used for a sustainability assessment of the alternatives while four MCDA methods were applied for the prioritisation: Weighted Sum Method (WSM), Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE). Regarding the sustainability performance indicators, the highest environmental impacts were calculated for the fireplace alternatives, and there was not a best environmental option. Also, no clear trend was found for the economic and social dimensions. The application of MCDA tools shows that wood stove alternatives have the best sustainability performance, in particular wood stove with combustion of maritime pine logs (highest scores in the ranking). Regarding the worst alternative, fireplaces with combustion of eucalypt logs ranked last in all MCDA rankings. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for the weighting of the performance indicators confirmed wood stoves with combustion of maritime pine logs as the leading alternative and the key role of the analysts within this type of MCDA studies.},

   abstract = {GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are increasingly being used in landslide susceptibility mapping. However, the uncertainties that are associated with MCDA techniques may significantly impact the results. This may sometimes lead to inaccurate outcomes and undesirable consequences. This article introduces a new GIS-based MCDA approach. We illustrate the consequences of applying different MCDA methods within a decision-making process through uncertainty analysis. Three GIS-MCDA methods in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and Dempster-Shafer theory are analyzed for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in the Urmia lake basin in Iran, which is highly susceptible to landslide hazards. The methodology comprises three stages. First, the LSM criteria are ranked and a sensitivity analysis is implemented to simulate error propagation based on the MCS. The resulting weights are expressed through probability density functions. Accordingly, within the second stage, three MCDA methods, namely analytical hierarchy process (AHP), weighted linear combination (WLC) and ordered weighted average (OWA), are used to produce the landslide susceptibility maps. In the third stage, accuracy assessments are carried out and the uncertainties of the different results are measured. We compare the accuracies of the three MCDA methods based on (1) the Dempster-Shafer theory and (2) a validation of the results using an inventory of known landslides and their respective coverage based on object-based image analysis of IRS-ID satellite images. The results of this study reveal that through the integration of GIS and MCDA models, it is possible to identify strategies for choosing an appropriate method for LSM. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the integration of MCDA and MCS can significantly improve the accuracy of the results. In LSM, the AHP method performed best, while the OWA reveals better performance in the reliability assessment. The WLC operation yielded poor results. © 2014 The Author(s).

   abstract = {This study presents a methodology for conducting sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of a GIS-based multi-criteria model used to assess flood vulnerability in a case study in Brazil. The paper explores the robustness of model outcomes against slight changes in criteria weights. One criterion was varied at-a-time, while others were fixed to their baseline values. An algorithm was developed using Python and a geospatial data abstraction library to automate the variation of weights, implement the ANP (analytic network process) tool, reclassify the raster results, compute the class switches, and generate an uncertainty surface. Results helped to identify highly vulnerable areas that are burdened by high uncertainty and to investigate which criteria contribute to this uncertainty. Overall, the criteria ‘houses with improper building material’ and ‘evacuation drills and training’ are the most sensitive ones, thus, requiring more accurate measurements. The sensitivity of these criteria is explained by their weights in the base run, their spatial distribution, and the spatial resolution. These findings can support decision makers to characterize, report, and mitigate uncertainty in vulnerability assessment. The case study results demonstrate that the developed approach is simple, flexible, transparent, and may be applied to other complex spatial problems.},

   abstract = {Identification of hospital sites and their ranking is important for the planning and development of any country's health infrastructure. The site selection problem is a typical multi-criteria decision making problem involving multiple stakeholders and their interests. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a promising approach to solve a location-based problem due to the constitution of various criteria involved in decision making. In this research, eleven criterion are chosen which are classified under three main criteria; socio-economic, geographical and environmental. This research aims to identify the appropriate MCDA method for the selection of a new hospital sites. Here, two MCDA methods named Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) are used. Further, Geographical Information System (GIS) based MCDA methodology is proposed in this paper. The results obtained with both AHP and FAHP methods are compared. This comparison is based on criterion rankings, proposed hospital locations and sensitivity analysis. The main difference in results is shown in the result of sensitivity analysis in which constant variation in site ranking is obtained when weight change analysis is performed using AHP. The FAHP result shows only one variation in site ranking after a change in weight from +10 to +20%. The result suggests that FAHP may be a better approach to the hospital site selection problem.},

   abstract = {GIS multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques are increasingly used in landslide susceptibility mapping for the prediction of future hazards, land use planning, as well as for hazard preparedness. However, the uncertainties associated with MCDA techniques are inevitable and model outcomes are open to multiple types of uncertainty. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. We access the uncertainty of landslide susceptibility maps produced with GIS-MCDA techniques. A new spatially-explicit approach and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) are employed to assess the uncertainties associated with two MCDA techniques, namely Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) implemented in GIS. The methodology is composed of three different phases. First, weights are computed to express the relative importance of factors (criteria) for landslide susceptibility. Next, the uncertainty and sensitivity of landslide susceptibility is analyzed as a function of weights using Monte Carlo Simulation and Global Sensitivity Analysis. Finally, the results are validated using a landslide inventory database and by applying DST. The comparisons of the obtained landslide susceptibility maps of both MCDA techniques with known landslides show that the AHP outperforms OWA. However, the OWA-generated landslide susceptibility map shows lower uncertainty than the AHP-generated map. The results demonstrate that further improvement in the accuracy of GIS-based MCDA can be achieved by employing an integrated uncertainty-sensitivity analysis approach, in which the uncertainty of landslide susceptibility model is decomposed and attributed to model's criteria weights. © 2014 The Authors.},
