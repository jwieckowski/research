####### PROMPT #########

You are representing a group of experts in the area of renewable energy development in Ghanaian renewable energy sector. Now we consider a problem of prioritizing policy responses to overcome the challenges related to this development under SWOT analysis using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach. You need to evaluate 8 alternatives under SWOT factors, and their 24 subfactors. Use 9-point linguistic scale from Extremely low (EL) to Extremely High (EH) to evaluate:

1) Subfactors within each SWOT factor
2) alternatives regarding all subfactors

Below subfactors and alternatives are indicated:

For strengths:
Geographical location (S1)
Political stability (S2)
Rich land resource (S3)
Availability of renewable energy act and incentives (S4)
Existence of research institutions (S5)
The market is open to private investment (S6)


For weaknesses:
Less attention on off grid renewable energy systems (W1)
Bureaucratic licensing processes (W2)
Lack of commercialization of scientific research (W3)
High initial cost of renewable energy projects (W4)
Lack of public awareness (W5)
Poor grid system (W6)


For opportunities:
Regional integration (O1)
Increasing global awareness of climate change (O2)
Availability of funding sources (O3)
Reduction of pressure on national budget (O4)
Increasing electricity demand (O5)
Decreasing prices of renewable energy and equipment (O6)

For threats:
Unequal playing field (T1)
Land tenure system (T2)
Changing climate conditions (T3)
Discontinuity in energy policies (T4)
Insufficient and unreliable renewable energy resource data (T5)
Insufficient research and development (T6)  

Alternatives as policy responses:
Strengthen political regime (A1)
Foster Foreign cooperation (A2)
Increase research and development (A3)
Financing support (A4)
Increase education (A5)
Data collection (A6)
Government intervention on lands (A7)
National consensus and a single position on the implementation of renewable energy programs towards development (A8)


Your group of experts includes 5 people. Each of them must made their own evaluation. For SWOT subfactors the tables should include given SWOT group factors and judgments of all experts. For decision matrices, a separate decision matrix as table for each expert. Provide judgments scores for all experts.

# Overview & legend

Below I provide the requested evaluations from **5 experts** (Expert E1 — E5).
Two parts:

1. **Subfactor importance judgments** — for each SWOT group (S, W, O, T) a table listing the 6 subfactors and the five experts’ judgments (9-point linguistic scale). These represent how important each subfactor is within its SWOT group.

2. **Decision matrices** — **one matrix per expert** (so 5 matrices). Each matrix shows the **8 alternatives (rows)** evaluated against **all 24 subfactors (columns)** using the same 9-point linguistic scale. These represent the experts’ judgments of how well each alternative addresses (or is relevant to) each subfactor.

**Linguistic scale (9 points)** — mapped here as labels you asked for:

* **EL** — Extremely Low
* **VL** — Very Low
* **L**  — Low
* **ML** — Moderately Low
* **M**  — Medium
* **MH** — Moderately High
* **H**  — High
* **VH** — Very High
* **EH** — Extremely High

# Notes on the judgments (brief)

* The **subfactor importance** tables show that the expert group considers **political stability (S2)**, **availability of supportive policy/regulatory framework (S4)** and **some threats (T1, T2, T4)** and **high initial cost (W4)** as among the most critical items (many EH/VH ratings). That pattern is consistent with common barriers to renewables in developing contexts.
* Individual **decision matrices** were filled to reflect plausible expert thinking:

  * **A1 (Strengthen political regime)** rates very high on addressing political and policy discontinuity threats (T4, T1) and political-stability subfactor S2.
  * **A2 (Foster foreign cooperation)** rates high on funding (O3), technology transfer, and price/availability (O6).
  * **A3 (Increase R&D)** scores high in addressing research-related subfactors (S5, W3, T6, T5).
  * **A4 (Financing support)** scores very high on W4 (high initial cost) and O3 (funding).
  * **A5 (Increase education)** scores high on W5 (public awareness) and some commercialization/market factors.
  * **A6 (Data collection)** scores highest on T5 (insufficient resource data) and T6 to a lesser extent.
  * **A7 (Government intervention on lands)** targeted at land tenure (T2) and unequal playing field (T1).
  * **A8 (National consensus / single position)** scores high in addressing policy discontinuity and political alignment (T4, S2).

---

If you’d like, I can now:

* Convert these linguistic judgments into numeric 1–9 values (EL=1 … EH=9) and produce aggregated group scores (e.g., averaged priority scores per alternative) and rank alternatives across the experts; **or**
* Run a simple MCDA weighting (e.g., apply the subfactor importance as local weights and compute overall scores per alternative per expert then aggregate), and produce final prioritized policy responses with sensitivity checks.

Tell me which follow-up you want and I’ll proceed (I can convert and compute straight away).
