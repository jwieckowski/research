####### PROMPT #########

You are an expert in the area of renewable energy development in Ghanaian renewable energy sector. Now we consider a problem of prioritizing policy responses to overcome the challenges related to this development under SWOT analysis using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach. You need to evaluate 8 alternatives under SWOT factors, and their 24 subfactors. Use 9-point linguistic scale from Extremely low (EL) to Extremely High (EH) to evaluate:

1) Subfactors within each SWOT factor
2) alternatives regarding all subfactors

Below subfactors and alternatives are indicated:

For strengths:
Geographical location (S1)
Political stability (S2)
Rich land resource (S3)
Availability of renewable energy act and incentives (S4)
Existence of research institutions (S5)
The market is open to private investment (S6)


For weaknesses:
Less attention on off grid renewable energy systems (W1)
Bureaucratic licensing processes (W2)
Lack of commercialization of scientific research (W3)
High initial cost of renewable energy projects (W4)
Lack of public awareness (W5)
Poor grid system (W6)


For opportunities:
Regional integration (O1)
Increasing global awareness of climate change (O2)
Availability of funding sources (O3)
Reduction of pressure on national budget (O4)
Increasing electricity demand (O5)
Decreasing prices of renewable energy and equipment (O6)

For threats:
Unequal playing field (T1)
Land tenure system (T2)
Changing climate conditions (T3)
Discontinuity in energy policies (T4)
Insufficient and unreliable renewable energy resource data (T5)
Insufficient research and development (T6)  

Alternatives as policy responses:
Strengthen political regime (A1)
Foster Foreign cooperation (A2)
Increase research and development (A3)
Financing support (A4)
Increase education (A5)
Data collection (A6)
Government intervention on lands (A7)
National consensus and a single position on the implementation of renewable energy programs towards development (A8)

You need to evaluate them and provide judgments in a tabular format. Subfactors for each SWOT factor separately, and evaluation of alternatives as matrix with all subfactors within one table.

### Evaluation of Subfactors within Each SWOT Factor

The evaluations below represent the relative importance of each subfactor within its respective SWOT category for the development of renewable energy in Ghana. As an expert, these judgments are based on the contextual significance of each subfactor in driving or hindering progress, considering Ghana's geographical, political, economic, and infrastructural realities. The 9-point linguistic scale is used to denote importance: Extremely Low (EL), Very Low (VL), Low (L), Moderately Low (ML), Medium (M), Moderately High (MH), High (H), Very High (VH), Extremely High (EH).

#### Strengths Subfactors

### Evaluation of Alternatives Regarding All Subfactors

The matrix below evaluates each alternative (policy response) in terms of its potential impact or effectiveness in addressing, leveraging, or mitigating each subfactor. For strengths and opportunities, the evaluation reflects how well the alternative leverages or enhances the factor. For weaknesses and threats, it reflects how well the alternative mitigates or overcomes the factor. Judgments are based on expert analysis of Ghana's renewable energy sector, considering policy feasibility, historical precedents, and interconnections between factors. The same 9-point linguistic scale is used: Extremely Low (EL), Very Low (VL), Low (L), Moderately Low (ML), Medium (M), Moderately High (MH), High (H), Very High (VH), Extremely High (EH).
