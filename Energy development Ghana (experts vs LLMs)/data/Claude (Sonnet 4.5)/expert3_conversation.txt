####### PROMPT #########

You are an expert in the area of renewable energy development in Ghanaian renewable energy sector. Now we consider a problem of prioritizing policy responses to overcome the challenges related to this development under SWOT analysis using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach. You need to evaluate 8 alternatives under SWOT factors, and their 24 subfactors. Use 9-point linguistic scale from Extremely low (EL) to Extremely High (EH) to evaluate:

1) Subfactors within each SWOT factor
2) alternatives regarding all subfactors

Below subfactors and alternatives are indicated:

For strengths:
Geographical location (S1)
Political stability (S2)
Rich land resource (S3)
Availability of renewable energy act and incentives (S4)
Existence of research institutions (S5)
The market is open to private investment (S6)


For weaknesses:
Less attention on off grid renewable energy systems (W1)
Bureaucratic licensing processes (W2)
Lack of commercialization of scientific research (W3)
High initial cost of renewable energy projects (W4)
Lack of public awareness (W5)
Poor grid system (W6)


For opportunities:
Regional integration (O1)
Increasing global awareness of climate change (O2)
Availability of funding sources (O3)
Reduction of pressure on national budget (O4)
Increasing electricity demand (O5)
Decreasing prices of renewable energy and equipment (O6)

For threats:
Unequal playing field (T1)
Land tenure system (T2)
Changing climate conditions (T3)
Discontinuity in energy policies (T4)
Insufficient and unreliable renewable energy resource data (T5)
Insufficient research and development (T6)  

Alternatives as policy responses:
Strengthen political regime (A1)
Foster Foreign cooperation (A2)
Increase research and development (A3)
Financing support (A4)
Increase education (A5)
Data collection (A6)
Government intervention on lands (A7)
National consensus and a single position on the implementation of renewable energy programs towards development (A8)

You need to evaluate them and provide judgments in a tabular format. Subfactors for each SWOT factor separately, and evaluation of alternatives as matrix with all subfactors within one table.

## Table 4: THREATS Subfactor Importance Evaluation

| Subfactor | Code | Importance Rating | Linguistic Term | Justification |
|-----------|------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Unequal playing field | T1 | 7 | H | Fossil fuel subsidies and incumbent advantages distort competition against renewables |
| Land tenure system | T2 | 8 | VH | Customary land ownership creates uncertainty; major impediment to project development |
| Changing climate conditions | T3 | 7 | H | Climate variability affects resource predictability (rainfall for hydro, wind patterns) |
| Discontinuity in energy policies | T4 | 8 | VH | Political transitions may disrupt policy frameworks; undermines investor confidence |
| Insufficient and unreliable renewable energy resource data | T5 | 9 | EH | Lack of comprehensive resource mapping prevents optimal project siting and financing |
| Insufficient research and development | T6 | 7 | H | Limited local R&D capacity constrains technology adaptation and innovation |
