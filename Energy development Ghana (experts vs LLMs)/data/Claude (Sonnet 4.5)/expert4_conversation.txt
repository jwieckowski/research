####### PROMPT #########

You are an expert in the area of renewable energy development in Ghanaian renewable energy sector. Now we consider a problem of prioritizing policy responses to overcome the challenges related to this development under SWOT analysis using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach. You need to evaluate 8 alternatives under SWOT factors, and their 24 subfactors. Use 9-point linguistic scale from Extremely low (EL) to Extremely High (EH) to evaluate:

1) Subfactors within each SWOT factor
2) alternatives regarding all subfactors

Below subfactors and alternatives are indicated:

For strengths:
Geographical location (S1)
Political stability (S2)
Rich land resource (S3)
Availability of renewable energy act and incentives (S4)
Existence of research institutions (S5)
The market is open to private investment (S6)


For weaknesses:
Less attention on off grid renewable energy systems (W1)
Bureaucratic licensing processes (W2)
Lack of commercialization of scientific research (W3)
High initial cost of renewable energy projects (W4)
Lack of public awareness (W5)
Poor grid system (W6)


For opportunities:
Regional integration (O1)
Increasing global awareness of climate change (O2)
Availability of funding sources (O3)
Reduction of pressure on national budget (O4)
Increasing electricity demand (O5)
Decreasing prices of renewable energy and equipment (O6)

For threats:
Unequal playing field (T1)
Land tenure system (T2)
Changing climate conditions (T3)
Discontinuity in energy policies (T4)
Insufficient and unreliable renewable energy resource data (T5)
Insufficient research and development (T6)  

Alternatives as policy responses:
Strengthen political regime (A1)
Foster Foreign cooperation (A2)
Increase research and development (A3)
Financing support (A4)
Increase education (A5)
Data collection (A6)
Government intervention on lands (A7)
National consensus and a single position on the implementation of renewable energy programs towards development (A8)

You need to evaluate them and provide judgments in a tabular format. Subfactors for each SWOT factor separately, and evaluation of alternatives as matrix with all subfactors within one table.

## Key Evaluation Rationale:

**Strengths Assessment:**
- S1, S4, and S6 rated highest (8) as they represent Ghana's core competitive advantages
- S5 rated moderately high (6) due to limited institutional capacity

**Weaknesses Assessment:**
- W4 rated highest (9) as initial capital represents the most critical barrier
- W2 and W6 rated very high (8) as systemic infrastructure challenges

**Opportunities Assessment:**
- O5 rated highest (9) reflecting urgent electricity demand pressures
- O2, O3, and O6 rated very high (8) due to favorable global trends

**Threats Assessment:**
- T4 rated highest (9) as policy discontinuity undermines long-term investment
- T2, T5, and T6 rated very high (8) as fundamental systemic challenges

**Alternative Performance:**
- **A2 (Foreign cooperation)** and **A4 (Financing)** score highly across most criteria
- **A8 (National consensus)** performs exceptionally on policy continuity and governance factors
- **A3 (R&D)** excels in technical and data-related subfactors
- **A7 (Land intervention)** specifically addresses land tenure issues but limited broader impact
