####### PROMPT #########

You are an expert in the area of renewable energy development in Ghanaian renewable energy sector. Now we consider a problem of prioritizing policy responses to overcome the challenges related to this development under SWOT analysis using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach. You need to evaluate 8 alternatives under SWOT factors, and their 24 subfactors. Use 9-point linguistic scale from Extremely low (EL) to Extremely High (EH) to evaluate:

1) Subfactors within each SWOT factor
2) alternatives regarding all subfactors

Below subfactors and alternatives are indicated:

For strengths:
Geographical location (S1)
Political stability (S2)
Rich land resource (S3)
Availability of renewable energy act and incentives (S4)
Existence of research institutions (S5)
The market is open to private investment (S6)


For weaknesses:
Less attention on off grid renewable energy systems (W1)
Bureaucratic licensing processes (W2)
Lack of commercialization of scientific research (W3)
High initial cost of renewable energy projects (W4)
Lack of public awareness (W5)
Poor grid system (W6)


For opportunities:
Regional integration (O1)
Increasing global awareness of climate change (O2)
Availability of funding sources (O3)
Reduction of pressure on national budget (O4)
Increasing electricity demand (O5)
Decreasing prices of renewable energy and equipment (O6)

For threats:
Unequal playing field (T1)
Land tenure system (T2)
Changing climate conditions (T3)
Discontinuity in energy policies (T4)
Insufficient and unreliable renewable energy resource data (T5)
Insufficient research and development (T6)  

Alternatives as policy responses:
Strengthen political regime (A1)
Foster Foreign cooperation (A2)
Increase research and development (A3)
Financing support (A4)
Increase education (A5)
Data collection (A6)
Government intervention on lands (A7)
National consensus and a single position on the implementation of renewable energy programs towards development (A8)

You need to evaluate them and provide judgments in a tabular format. Subfactors for each SWOT factor separately, and evaluation of alternatives as matrix with all subfactors within one table.

# SWOT-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis for Ghana's Renewable Energy Sector

I'll provide comprehensive evaluations using the 9-point linguistic scale where:
- **EL (Extremely Low) = 1**
- **VL (Very Low) = 2**
- **L (Low) = 3**
- **ML (Medium Low) = 4**
- **M (Medium) = 5**
- **MH (Medium High) = 6**
- **H (High) = 7**
- **VH (Very High) = 8**
- **EH (Extremely High) = 9**

## Table 1: Evaluation of STRENGTHS Subfactors

| Increasing electricity demand | O5 | 8 | VH | 7-8% annual growth; industrialization driving consumption |
| Decreasing prices of renewable energy and equipment | O6 | 8 | VH | Solar PV costs dropped 90% since 2010; wind increasingly competitive |

## Table 4: Evaluation of THREATS Subfactors

| Subfactor | Code | Severity Rating | Linguistic Term | Justification |
|-----------|------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Unequal playing field | T1 | 7 | H | Fossil fuel subsidies distort market; RE faces unfair competition |

## Key Evaluation Rationale:

**Strongest Alternative-Subfactor Matches:**
- **A3 (R&D)** excellently addresses W3 (commercialization), S5 (research institutions), T5 (resource data), T6 (R&D capacity)
- **A4 (Financing)** directly tackles W4 (high costs), leverages O3 (funding sources), O4 (budget relief)
- **A7 (Land intervention)** specifically solves T2 (land tenure), utilizes S3 (land resources)
- **A8 (National consensus)** addresses T4 (policy discontinuity), S2 (political stability), O2 (climate awareness)

**Critical Observations:**
1. No single alternative addresses all subfactors equally
2. Complementary implementation of multiple alternatives recommended
3. A8 (National consensus) shows broad moderate-to-high impact across most subfactors
4. A3 (R&D) and A4 (Financing) are essential foundations for technical and economic viability

This evaluation framework enables weighting schemes and further MCDA processing (AHP, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE, etc.) for final prioritization.
